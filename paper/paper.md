# Summary

A major trend in academia and data science is the rapid adoption of Bayesian statistics for data analysis and modeling, 
leading to the development of probabilistic programming languages (PPL). A PPL provides a framework that allows users 
to easily specify a probabilistic model and perform inference automatically. `PyAutoFit` is a Python-based PPL which 
interfaces with all aspects of the modeling (e.g., the model, data, fitting procedure, visualization, results) and
therefore provides complete management of every aspect of modeling. This includes composing high-dimensionality models 
from individual model components, customizing the fitting procedure and performing data augmentation before a model-fit. 
Advanced features include database tools for analysing large suites of modeling results and exploiting domain-specific 
knowledge of a problem via non-linear search chaining. Accompanying `PyAutoFit` is the [autofit workspace](https://github.com/Jammy2211/autofit_workspace), 
which includes example scripts and the `HowToFit` lecture series which introduces non-experts to model-fitting and 
provides a guide on how to begin a project using `PyAutoFit`. Readers can try `PyAutoFit` right now by 
going to [the introduction Jupyter notebook on Binder](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/Jammy2211/autofit_workspace/HEAD)
or checkout our [readthedocs](https://pyautofit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) for a complete overview
of **PyAutoFit**'s features.

# Background of Probabilistic Programming

Probabilistic programming languages (PPLs) have enabled contemporary statistical inference techniques to be applied 
to a diverse range of problems across academia and industry. Packages such as PyMC3 [@Salvatier2016], 
Pyro [@Bingham2019] and STAN [@Carpenter2017] offer general-purpose frameworks where users can specify a generative 
model and fit it to data using a variety of non-linear fitting techniques. Each package is specialized to problems 
of a certain nature, with many focused on problems like generalized linear modeling or determining the 
distribution(s) from which the data was drawn. For these problems the model is typically composed of the equations and
distributions that are fitted to the data, which are easily expressed syntactically such that the PPL API offers an 
expressive way to define the model and extensions can be implemented in an intuitive and straightforward way.

# Statement of Need

`PyAutoFit` is a PPL whose core design is providing a direct interface with the model, data, fitting procedure and 
results, allowing it to provide comprehensive management of many different aspects of model-fitting. **PyAutoFit** began 
as an Astronomy project for fitting large imaging datasets of galaxies, after the developers found that existing PPLs 
were not suited to the type of model fitting problems Astronomers faced. This includes efficiently analysing large and 
homogenous datasets with an identical model fitting procedure, making it straight forward to fit many models to 
large datasets with streamlined model comparison and massively parallel support for problems where an expensive 
likelihood function means run-times can be of order days or longer. More recent development has generalized `PyAutoFit`, 
making it suitable to a broader range of model-fitting problems.

# Software Description

To compose a model with `PyAutoFit` model components are written as Python classes, allowing `PyAutoFit` to 
define the model and associated parameters in an expressive way that is tied to the modeling software's API. A 
model fit then requires that a `PyAutoFit` `Analysis` class is written, which combines the data, model and likelihood 
function and defines how the model-fit is performed using a `NonLinearSearch`. The `NonLinearSearch`
procedure is defined using an external inference library such as `dynesty` [@dynesty], `emcee` [@emcee]
or `PySwarms` [@pyswarms]. 

The `Analysis` class provides a model specific interface between `PyAutoFit` and the modeling software, allowing it 
to handle the 'heavy lifting' that comes with writing model-fitting software. This includes interfacing with the 
non-linear search, outputting results in a structured path format and model-specific visualization during and 
after the non-linear search. Results are output in a database structure that allows the `Aggregator` tool to load 
results post-analysis via a Python script or Jupyter notebook. This includes methods for summarizing the results of 
every fit, filtering results to inspect subsets of model fits and visualizing results. Results are loaded as `Python` 
generators, ensuring the `Aggregator` can be used to interpret large files in a memory efficient way. `PyAutoFit` is 
therefore suited to 'big data' problems where independent fits to large homogeneous data-sets using an identical 
model-fitting procedure are performed. 

# Model Abstraction and Composition

For many modeling problems the model comprises abstract model components representing objects or processes in a 
physical system. For example, galaxy morphology studies in astrophysics where model components represent the light 
profile of stars [@Haussler2013; @Nightingale2019]. For these problems the likelihood function is typically a 
sequence of numerical processes (e.g., convolutions, Fourier transforms, linear algebra) and extensions to the model 
often requires the addition of new model components in a way that is non-trivially included in the fitting process 
and likelihood function. Existing PPLs have tools for these problems, for example 'black-box' likelihood functions 
in PyMC3. However, these solutions decouple model composition from the data and fitting procedure, making the model 
less expressive, restricting model customization and reducing flexibility in how the model-fit is performed.

By writing model components as Python classes, the model and its associated parameters are defined in an expressive 
way that is tied to the modeling software’s API. Model composition with `PyAutoFit` allows complex models to be built 
from these individual components, abstracting the details of how they change model-fitting procedure from the user. 
Models can be fully customized, allowing adjustment of individual parameter priors, the fixing or coupling of 
parameters between model components and removing regions of parameter space via parameter assertions. Adding new model 
components to a `PyAutoFit` project is straightforward, whereby adding a new Python class means it works within 
the entire modeling framework. `PyAutoFit` is therefore ideal for problems where there is a desire to compose, fit and 
compare many similar (but slightly different) models to a single dataset, with the `Aggregator` including tools to 
facilitate this. 

For many model fitting problems, domain specific knowledge of the model can be exploited to speed up the non-linear 
search and ensure it locates the global maximum likelihood solution. For example, initial fits can be performed 
using simplified model parameterizations, augmented datasets and faster non-linear fitting techniques. Through 
experience users may know that certain model components share minimal covariance, meaning that separate fits to each 
model component (in parameter spaces of reduced dimensionality) can be performed before fitting them simultaneously. 
The results of these simplified fits can then be used to initialize fits using a higher dimensionality model. 
Breaking down a model-fit in this way uses `PyAutoFit`'s non-linear search chaining, which granularizes the non-linear 
fitting procedure into a series of linked non-linear searches. Initial model-fits are followed by fits that gradually 
increase the model complexity, using the information gained throughout the pipeline to guide each `NonLinearSearch` 
and thus enable accurate fitting of models of arbitrary complexity.

# History

`PyAutoFit` is a generalization of [PyAutoLens](https://github.com/Jammy2211/PyAutoLens), an Astronomy package 
developed to analyse images of gravitationally lensed galaxies. Modeling gravitational lenses historically requires 
large amounts of human time and supervision, an approach which does not scale to the incoming samples of 100000 objects. 
Domain exploitation enabled full automation of the lens modeling procedure [@Nightingale2015; @Nightingale2018], with 
model customization and the aggregator enabling one to fit large datasets with many different models. More 
recently, `PyAutoFit` has been applied to calibrating radiation damage to charge coupled imaging devices and a model 
of cancer tumour growth.  
 
# Workspace and HowToFit Tutorials

`PyAutoFit` is distributed with the [autofit workspace](https://github.com/Jammy2211/autofit_workspace), which 
contains example scripts for composing a model, performing a fit, using the `Aggregator` and `PyAutoFit`'s advanced 
statistical inference methods. Also included are the `HowToFit` tutorials, a series of Jupyter notebooks aimed at 
non-experts, introducing them to model-fitting and Bayesian inference. They teach users how to write model-components 
and `Analysis` classes in `PyAutoFit`, use these to fit a dataset and interpret the model-fitting results. The lectures 
are available on our [Binder](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/Jammy2211/autofit_workspace/HEAD) and may therefore be 
taken without a local `PyAutoFit` installation.
