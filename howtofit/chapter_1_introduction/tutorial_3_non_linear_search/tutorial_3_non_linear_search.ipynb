        "\n",
        "Okay, so its finally time to take our model and fit it to data, hurrah!\n",
        "\n",
        "So, how do we infer the parameters for the 1D _Gaussian_ that give a good fit to our data?  In the last tutorial, we\n",
        "tried a very basic approach, randomly guessing models until we found one that gave a good fit and high log_likelihood.\n",
        "\n",
        "We discussed that this wasn't really a viable strategy for more complex models, and it isn't. However, this is the\n",
        "basis of how model fitting actually works! Basically, our model-fitting algorithm guesses lots of models, tracking\n",
        "the log likelihood of these models. As the algorithm progresses, it begins to guess more models using parameter\n",
        "combinations that gave higher log_likelihood solutions previously. If a set of parameters provided a good fit to the\n",
        "data previously, a model with similar values probably will too.\n",
        "\n",
        "This is called a 'non-linear search' and its a fairly common problem faced by scientists. We're going to use a\n",
        "non-linear search algorithm called 'Emcee', which for those familiar with statistic inference is a Markov Chain Monte\n",
        "Carlo (MCMC) method. For now, lets not worry about the details of how Emcee actually works. Instead, just picture that\n",
        "a non-linear search in PyAutoFit operates as follows:\n",
        "\n",
        " 1) Randomly guess a model, mapping their parameters via the priors to instances of the model, in this case a\n",
        " Gaussian.\n",
        "\n",
        " 2) Use this model instance to generate model data and compare this model data to the data to compute a log\n",
        " likelihood.\n",
        "\n",
        " 3) Repeat this many times, choosing models whose parameter values are near those of the model which currently has\n",
        " the highest log likelihood value. If the new model's log likelihood is higher than the previous model, new\n",
        " models will thus be chosen with parameters nearer this model.\n",
        "\n",
        "The idea is that if we keep guessing models with higher log-likelihood values, we'll inevitably 'climb' up the gradient\n",
        "of the log likelihood in parameter space until we eventually hit the highest log likelihood models.\n",
        "\n",
        "To be clear, this overly simplfied description of an MCMC algorithm is not how the *non-linear search* really works and\n",
        "omits the details of how our priors inpact our inference or why an MCMC algorithm can provide reliable errors on our\n",
        "parameter estimates.\n",
