    "Tutorial 7: Phase Customization\n",
    "===============================\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we're going to add input parameters to a Phase object that customizes the analysis. We'll use the\n",
    "specific example of two input parameters that trim our data-set from the left and right before fitting it. This\n",
    "example is somewhat trivial (we could achieve almost the same effect with masking), but it will serve to illustrate\n",
    "phase customization.\n",
    "\n",
    "When we customize a phase, we'll use these 'phase settings' to perform phase tagging. Here, we 'tag' the output\n",
    "path of the phase's results, such that every time a phase is run with a different customization a new set of\n",
    "unique results are stored for those settings. For a given data-set we are thus able to fit it multiple times using\n",
    "different settings to compare the results.\n",
    "\n",
    "These new features have led to additional modules in the 'phase' package called 'meta_dataset.py' and 'settings.py'.\n",
    "Before looking at these modules, lets first perform a series of Emcee fits to see how they change the behaviour\n",
    "of PyAutoFit."
