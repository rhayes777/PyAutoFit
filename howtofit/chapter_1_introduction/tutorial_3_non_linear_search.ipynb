        "=============================\n",
        "\n",
        "Its finally time to take our model and fit it to data, hurrah!\n",
        "\n",
        "So, how do we infer the parameters for the 1D `Gaussian` that give a good fit to our data?  In the last tutorial, we\n",
        "tried a very basic approach, randomly guessing models until we found one that gave a good fit and high log_likelihood.\n",
        "\n",
        "We discussed that this wasn`t a viable strategy for more complex models. Surprisingly, this is the basis of how model\n",
        "fitting actually works! Basically, our model-fitting algorithm guesses lots of models, tracking the log likelihood of\n",
        "these models. As the algorithm progresses, it begins to guess more models using parameter combinations that gave higher\n",
        "log_likelihood solutions previously. If a set of parameters provided a good fit to the data previously, a model with\n",
        "similar values probably will too.\n",
        "\n",
        "This is called a `NonLinearSearch` and its a fairly common tool used by scientists in a wide range of fields. We're\n",
        "going to use a NonLinearSearch algorithm called `Emcee`, which for those familiar with statistic inference is a Markov\n",
        "Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method. For now, lets not worry about the details of how Emcee actually works. Instead, just\n",
        "picture that a `NonLinearSearch` in **PyAutoFit** operates as follows:\n",
        "\n",
        " 1) Randomly guess a model and map the parameters via the priors to an instance of the model, in this case\n",
        " our `Gaussian`.\n",
        "\n",
        " 2) Use this model instance to generate model data and compare this model data to the data to compute a log likelihood.\n",
        "\n",
        " 3) Repeat this many times, choosing models whose parameter values are near those of models which have higher log\n",
        " likelihood values. If a new model's log likelihood is higher than previous models, new models will be chosen with\n",
        " parameters nearer this model.\n",
        "\n",
        "The idea is that if we keep guessing models with higher log-likelihood values, we'll inevitably `climb` up the gradient\n",
        "of the log likelihood in parameter space until we eventually hit the highest log likelihood models.\n",
        "\n",
        "To be clear, this overly simplflied description of an MCMC algorithm is not how the *NonLinearSearch* really works. We\n",
        "are omitting crucial details on how our priors impact our inference as well as how the MCMC algorithm provides us with\n",
        "reliable errors on our parameter estimates. The goal of this chapter to teach you how to use **PyAutoFit**, not how to\n",
