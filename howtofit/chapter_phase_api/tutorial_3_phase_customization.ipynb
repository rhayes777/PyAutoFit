        "example is somewhat trivial, but it will serve to illustrate `Phase` settings and customization.\n",
        "\n",
        "When we customize a `Phase`, we'll use `SettingsPhase` to perform `tagging`. Here, we `tag` the output\n",
        "path of the `Phase`'s `Result`'s, such that every time a `Phase` is run with a different customization a new set of\n",
        "unique `Result`'s are stored for those `PhaseSetting`'s. For a given `Dataset` we are thus able to fit it multiple\n",
        "times using different settings to compare the results.\n",
        "\n",
        "These new features have led to an additional module in the `phase` package called `settings.py`, as well as extensions\n",
        "to the `dataset.py` module. Before looking at these modules, lets first perform a series of `Emcee` fits to see how\n",
