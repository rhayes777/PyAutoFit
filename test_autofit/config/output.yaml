# Determines whether files saved by the search are output to the hard-disk. This is true both when saving to the
# directory structure and when saving to database.

# Files can be listed name: bool where the name is the name of the file without a suffix (e.g. model not model.json)
# and bool is true or false.

# If a given file is not listed then the default value is used.

default: true # If true then files which are not explicitly listed here are output anyway. If false then they are not.

### Samples ###

# The `samples.csv`file contains every sampled value of every free parameter with its log likelihood and weight.

# This file is often large, therefore disabling it can significantly reduce hard-disk space use.

# `samples.csv` is used to perform marginalization, infer model parameter errors and do other analysis of the search
# chains. Even if output of `samples.csv` is disabled, these tasks are still performed by the fit and output to
# the `samples_summary.json` file. However, without a `samples.csv` file these types of tasks cannot be performed
# after the fit is complete, for example via the database.

samples: true

### Search Internal ###

# The search internal folder which contains a saved state of the non-linear search, as a .pickle or .dill file.

# If the entry below is false, the folder is still output during the model-fit, as it is required to resume the fit
# from where it left off. Therefore, settings `false` below does not impact model-fitting checkpointing and resumption.
# Instead, the search internal folder is deleted once the fit is completed.

# The search internal folder file is often large, therefore deleting it after a fit is complete can significantly
# reduce hard-disk space use.

# The search internal representation (e.g. what you can load from the output .pickle file) may have additional
# quantities specific to the non-linear search that you are interested in inspecting. Deleting the folder means this
# information is list.

search_internal: true

# Other Files:

covariance: true # `covariance.csv`: The [free parameters x free parameters] covariance matrix.
derived_quantities: true # `latent/samples.csv`: Values of every derived quantity, which are not model free parameter but values computed from them.
data: true # `data.json`: The value of every data point in the data.
noise_map: true # `noise_map.json`: The value of every RMS noise map value.
