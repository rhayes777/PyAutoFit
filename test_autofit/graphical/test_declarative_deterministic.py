"""
Seam tests for the declarative → graph lowering contract
(`autofit/graphical/README.md` §7), focused on deterministic quantities
expressed as compound priors.

History: PR #1153 introduced this pattern with an illustration test that
was committed commented-out; the accompanying `model.<property>` sugar
was later deliberately reverted (`be6411755`, "undo annoying change").
The *explicit* compound-prior pattern below is the supported one — these
tests pin its lowering behaviour so the seam cannot silently drift again
(EP review Phase 5, PyAutoFit #1336).
