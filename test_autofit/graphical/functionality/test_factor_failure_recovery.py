"""
An `InitializerException` in one factor should not kill the whole EP fit.

A factor's own optimiser can fail to find a start point — most often because EP
has driven that factor to a state where every drawn point has the same figure of
merit. That is a failure of one sweep's update for one factor, not of the graph
fit, so the sweep should continue on that factor's previous message with the
failure recorded.

These tests use a **shared-variable, non-hierarchical** graph, which is the shape
that reproduced this on the release leg (PyAutoFit#1405): two factors connected by
one shared variable, no `HierarchicalFactor` involved.
