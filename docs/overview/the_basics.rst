The Basics
==========

**PyAutoFit** is a Python based probabilistic programming language for model fitting and Bayesian inference
of large datasets.

The basic **PyAutoFit** API allows us a user to quickly compose a probabilistic model and fit it to data via a
log likelihood function, using a range of non-linear search algorithms (e.g. MCMC, nested sampling).

This overview gives a run through of:

 - **Models**: Use Python classes to compose the model which is fitted to data.
 - **Instances**: Create instances of the model via its Python class.
 - **Analysis**: Define an ``Analysis`` class which includes the log likelihood function that fits the model to the data.
 - **Searches**: Choose an MCMC, nested sampling or maximum likelihood estimator non-linear search algorithm that fits the model to the data.
 - **Model Fit**: Fit the model to the data using the chosen non-linear search, with on-the-fly results and visualization.
 - **Results**: Use the results of the search to interpret and visualize the model fit.
- **Samples**: Use the samples of the search to inspect the parameter samples and visualize the probability density function of the results.
- **Multiple Datasets**: Dedicated support for simultaneously fitting multiple datasets, enabling scalable analysis of large datasets.

This overviews provides a high level of the basic API, with more advanced functionality described in the following
overviews and the **PyAutoFit** cookbooks.

Example
-------

To illustrate **PyAutoFit** we'll use the example modeling problem of fitting a 1D Gaussian profile to noisy data.

To begin, lets import ``autofit`` (and ``numpy``) using the convention below:

.. code-block:: python

    import autofit as af
    import numpy as np


The example ``data`` with errors (black) is shown below:

.. image:: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rhayes777/PyAutoFit/main/docs/images/data.png
  :width: 600
  :alt: Alternative text

The 1D signal was generated using a 1D Gaussian profile of the form:

.. math::

    g(x, I, \sigma) = \frac{N}{\sigma\sqrt{2\pi}} \exp{(-0.5 (x / \sigma)^2)}

Where:

 ``x``: The x-axis coordinate where the ``Gaussian`` is evaluated.

 ``N``: The overall normalization of the Gaussian.

 ``sigma``: Describes the size of the Gaussian.

Our modeling task is to fit the data with a 1D Gaussian and recover its parameters (``x``, ``N``, ``sigma``).

Model
-----

We therefore need to define a 1D Gaussian as a **PyAutoFit** model.

We do this by writing it as the following Python class:

.. code-block:: python

    class Gaussian:
        def __init__(
            self,
            centre=0.0,  # <- PyAutoFit recognises these constructor arguments
            normalization=0.1,  # <- are the Gaussian`s model parameters.
            sigma=0.01,
        ):
            """
            Represents a 1D `Gaussian` profile, which can be treated as a
            PyAutoFit model-component whose free parameters (centre,
            normalization and sigma) are fitted for by a non-linear search.

            Parameters
            ----------
            centre
                The x coordinate of the profile centre.
            normalization
                Overall normalization of the `Gaussian` profile.
            sigma
                The sigma value controlling the size of the Gaussian.
            """
            self.centre = centre
            self.normalization = normalization
            self.sigma = sigma

        def model_data_from(self, xvalues: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:
            """
            Returns the 1D Gaussian profile on a line of Cartesian x coordinates.

            The input xvalues are translated to a coordinate system centred on the
            Gaussian, by subtracting its centre.

            The output is referred to as the `model_data` to signify that it is
            a representation of the data from the model.

            Parameters
            ----------
            xvalues
                The x coordinates for which the Gaussian is evaluated.
            """
            transformed_xvalues = xvalues - self.centre

            return np.multiply(
                np.divide(self.normalization, self.sigma * np.sqrt(2.0 * np.pi)),
                np.exp(-0.5 * np.square(np.divide(transformed_xvalues, self.sigma))),
            )

The **PyAutoFit** model above uses the following format:

- The name of the class is the name of the model, in this case, "Gaussian".

- The input arguments of the constructor (the ``__init__`` method) are the parameters of the model, in this case ``centre``, ``normalization`` and ``sigma``.
  
- The default values of the input arguments define whether a parameter is a single-valued ``float`` or a multi-valued ``tuple``. In this case, all 3 input parameters are floats.
  
- It includes functions associated with that model component, which are used when fitting the model to data.


To compose a model using the ``Gaussian`` class above we use the ``af.Model`` object.

.. code-block:: python

    model = af.Model(Gaussian)
    print("Model ``Gaussian`` object: \n")
    print(model)

This gives the following output:

.. code-block:: bash

    Model `Gaussian` object:

    Gaussian (centre, UniformPrior [1], lower_limit = 0.0, upper_limit = 100.0),
    (normalization, LogUniformPrior [2], lower_limit = 1e-06, upper_limit = 1000000.0),
    (sigma, UniformPrior [3], lower_limit = 0.0, upper_limit = 25.0)

.. note::

    **PyAutoFit** supports the use of configuration files defining the default priors on every model parameter, which is
    how the priors above were set. This allows the user to set up default priors in a consistent and concise way, but
    with a high level of customization and extensibility. The use of config files to set up default behaviour is
    described in the `configs cookbook <https://pyautofit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/cookbooks/configs.html>`_.

The model has a total of 3 parameters:

.. code-block:: python

    print(model.total_free_parameters)

All model information is given by printing its ``info`` attribute:

.. code-block:: python

    print(model.info)

This gives the following output:

.. code-block:: bash

    Total Free Parameters = 3

    model                         Gaussian (N=3)

    centre                        UniformPrior [1], lower_limit = 0.0, upper_limit = 100.0
    normalization                 LogUniformPrior [2], lower_limit = 1e-06, upper_limit = 1000000.0
    sigma                         UniformPrior [3], lower_limit = 0.0, upper_limit = 25.0

The priors can be manually altered as follows:

.. code-block:: python

    model.centre = af.UniformPrior(lower_limit=0.0, upper_limit=100.0)
    model.normalization = af.UniformPrior(lower_limit=0.0, upper_limit=1e2)
    model.sigma = af.UniformPrior(lower_limit=0.0, upper_limit=30.0)

Printing the ``model.info`` displayed these updated priors.

.. code-block:: python

    print(model.info)

This gives the following output:

.. code-block:: bash

    Total Free Parameters = 3

    model                                   Gaussian (N=3)

    centre                                  UniformPrior [4], lower_limit = 0.0, upper_limit = 100.0
    normalization                           UniformPrior [5], lower_limit = 0.0, upper_limit = 100.0
    sigma                                   UniformPrior [6], lower_limit = 0.0, upper_limit = 30.0

.. note::

    The example above uses the most basic PyAutoFit API to compose a simple model. The API is highly extensible and
    can scale to models with thousands of parameters, complex hierarchies and relationships between parameters.
    A complete overview is given in the `model cookbook <https://pyautofit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/cookbooks/model.html>`_.

Instances
---------

Instances of a **PyAutoFit** model (created via `af.Model`) can be generated by mapping an input `vector` of parameter
values to create an instance of the model's Python class.

To define the input `vector` correctly, we need to know the order of parameters in the model. This information is
contained in the model's `paths` attribute.

.. code-block:: python

    print(model.paths)

This gives the following output:

.. code-block:: bash

    [('centre',), ('normalization',), ('sigma',)]

We input values for the three free parameters of our model in the order specified by the `paths`
attribute (i.e., `centre=30.0`, `normalization=2.0`, and `sigma=3.0`):

.. code-block:: python

    instance = model.instance_from_vector(vector=[30.0, 2.0, 3.0])

This is an instance of the ``Gaussian`` class.

.. code-block:: python

    print("Model Instance: \n")
    print(instance)

This gives the following output:

.. code-block:: bash

    Model Instance:

    <__main__.Gaussian object at 0x7f3e37cb1990>

It has the parameters of the ``Gaussian`` with the values input above.

.. code-block:: python

    print("Instance Parameters \n")
    print("x = ", instance.centre)
    print("normalization = ", instance.normalization)
    print("sigma = ", instance.sigma)

This gives the following output:

.. code-block:: bash

    Instance Parameters

    x =  30.0
    normalization =  2.0
    sigma =  3.0

We can use functions associated with the class, specifically the ``model_data_from`` function, to
create a realization of the ``Gaussian`` and plot it.

.. code-block:: python

    xvalues = np.arange(0.0, 100.0, 1.0)

    model_data = instance.model_data_from(xvalues=xvalues)

    plt.plot(xvalues, model_data, color="r")
    plt.title("1D Gaussian Model Data.")
    plt.xlabel("x values of profile")
    plt.ylabel("Gaussian Value")
    plt.show()
    plt.clf()

Here is what the plot looks like:

.. image:: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rhayes777/PyAutoFit/main/docs/images/model_gaussian.png
  :width: 600
  :alt: Alternative text

.. note::

    Mapping models to instance of their Python classes is an integral part of the core **PyAutoFit** API. It enables
    the advanced model composition and results management tools illustrated in the following overviews and cookbooks.

Analysis
--------

We now tell **PyAutoFit** how to fit the model to the data.

We define an ``Analysis`` class, which includes:

- An ``__init__`` constructor that takes ``data`` and ``noise_map`` as inputs (this can be extended with additional elements necessary for fitting the model to the data).

- A ``log_likelihood_function`` that defines how to fit an ``instance`` of the model to the data and return a log likelihood value.

Read the comments and docstrings of the ``Analysis`` class in detail for a full description of how the analysis works.

.. code-block:: python

    class Analysis(af.Analysis):
        def __init__(self, data: np.ndarray, noise_map: np.ndarray):
            """
            The ``Analysis`` class acts as an interface between the data and
            model in **PyAutoFit**.

            Its ``log_likelihood_function`` defines how the model is fitted to
            the data and it is called many times by the non-linear search fitting
            algorithm.

            In this example the ``Analysis`` ``__init__`` constructor only contains
            the ``data`` and ``noise-map``, but it can be easily extended to
            include other quantities.

            Parameters
            ----------
            data
                A 1D numpy array containing the data (e.g. a noisy 1D signal)
                fitted in the readthedocs and workspace examples.
            noise_map
                A 1D numpy array containing the noise values of the data, used
                for computing the goodness of fit metric, the log likelihood.
            """

            super().__init__()

            self.data = data
            self.noise_map = noise_map

        def log_likelihood_function(self, instance) -> float:
            """
            Returns the log likelihood of a fit of a 1D Gaussian to the dataset.

            The data is fitted using an ``instance`` of the ``Gaussian`` class

            create a model data representation of the Gaussian that is fitted to the data.

            on where it has mapped out the high likelihood regions of parameter space are.

            statements when we run the non-linear search, but feel free to uncomment

            return log_likelihood

Create an instance of the ``Analysis`` class by passing the ``data`` and ``noise_map``.

.. code-block:: python

    analysis = Analysis(data=data, noise_map=noise_map)

.. note::

    The `Analysis` class shown above is the simplest example possible. The API is highly extensible and can include
    model-specific output, visualization and latent variable calculations. A complete overview is given in the
    `analysis cookbook <https://pyautofit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/cookbooks/analysis.html>`_.

Non Linear Search
-----------------

We now have a model ready to fit the data and an analysis class that performs this fit.

Next, we need to select a fitting algorithm, known as a "non-linear search," to fit the model to the data.

**PyAutoFit** supports various non-linear searches, which can be broadly categorized into three
types: MCMC (Markov Chain Monte Carlo), nested sampling, and maximum likelihood estimators.

For this example, we will use the nested sampling algorithm called Dynesty.

.. code-block:: python

    search = af.DynestyStatic(
        nlive=100, # Example how to customize the search settings
    )


The default settings of the non-linear search are specified in the configuration files of **PyAutoFit**, just
like the default priors of the model components above. The ensures the basic API of your code is concise and
readable, but with the flexibility to customize the search to your specific model-fitting problem.

.. note::

    PyAutoFit supports a wide range of non-linear searches, including detailed visualuzation, support for parallel
    processing, and GPU and gradient based methods using the library JAX (https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
    A complete overview is given in the `searches cookbook <https://pyautofit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/cookbooks/search.html>`_.

Model Fit
---------

We begin the non-linear search by passing the model and analysis to its ``fit`` method.

.. code-block:: python

    print(
        The non-linear search has begun running.
        This Jupyter notebook cell with progress once the search
        has completed - this could take a few minutes!
    )

    result = search.fit(model=model, analysis=analysis)

    print("The search has finished run - you may now continue the notebook.")


Result
------

The result object returned by the fit provides information on the results of the non-linear search. 

The ``info`` attribute shows the result in a readable format.

.. code-block:: python

    print(result.info)

The output is as follows:

.. code-block:: bash

    Bayesian Evidence                       167.54413502
    Maximum Log Likelihood                  183.29775793

    normalization                           24.80 (23.98, 25.67)
    sigma                                   9.84 (9.47, 10.25)


    Summary (1.0 sigma limits):

    centre                                  49.88 (49.75, 50.01)
    normalization                           24.80 (24.54, 25.11)
    sigma                                   9.84 (9.73, 9.97)

Results are returned as instances of the model, as illustrated above in the instance section.

For example, we can print the result's maximum likelihood instance.

.. code-block:: python

    print(result.max_log_likelihood_instance)

    print("\nModel-fit Max Log-likelihood Parameter Estimates: \n")
    print("Centre = ", result.max_log_likelihood_instance.centre)
    print("Normalization = ", result.max_log_likelihood_instance.normalization)
    print("Sigma = ", result.max_log_likelihood_instance.sigma)

This gives the following output:

.. code-block:: bash

    Model-fit Max Log-likelihood Parameter Estimates:

    Centre =  49.87954357347897
    Normalization =  24.80227227310798
    Sigma =  9.84888033338011

A benefit of the result being an instance is that we can use any of its methods to inspect the results.

Below, we use the maximum likelihood instance to compare the maximum likelihood ``Gaussian`` to the data.

.. code-block:: python

    model_data = result.max_log_likelihood_instance.model_data_from(
        xvalues=np.arange(data.shape[0])
    )

    plt.errorbar(
        x=xvalues, y=data, yerr=noise_map, color="k", ecolor="k", elinewidth=1, capsize=2
    )
    plt.plot(xvalues, model_data, color="r")
    plt.title("Dynesty model fit to 1D Gaussian dataset.")
    plt.xlabel("x values of profile")
    plt.ylabel("Profile normalization")
    plt.show()
    plt.close()

The plot appears as follows:

.. image:: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rhayes777/PyAutoFit/main/docs/images/toy_model_fit.png
  :width: 600
  :alt: Alternative text

.. note::

    Result objects contain a wealth of information on the model-fit, including parameter and error estimates. They can
    be extensively customized to include additional information specific to your scientific problem. A complete overview
    is given in the `results cookbook <https://pyautofit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/cookbooks/result.html>`_.

Samples
-------

The results object also contains a ``Samples`` object, which contains all information on the non-linear search.

This includes parameter samples, log likelihood values, posterior information and results internal to the specific
algorithm (e.g. the internal dynesty samples).

Below we use the samples to plot the probability density function cornerplot of the results.

.. code-block:: python

    plotter = aplt.NestPlotter(samples=result.samples)
    plotter.corner_anesthetic()

The plot appears as follows:

.. image:: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rhayes777/PyAutoFit/main/docs/images/corner.png
  :width: 600
  :alt: Alternative text

.. note::

    The `results cookbook <https://pyautofit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/cookbooks/result.html>`_ also provides
    a run through of the samples object API.

Multiple Datasets
-----------------

Many model-fitting problems require multiple datasets to be fitted simultaneously in order to provide the best
constraints on the model.

In **PyAutoFit**, all you have to do to fit multiple datasets is sum your ``Analysis`` classes together:

.. code-block:: python

    analysis_0 = Analysis(data=data_0, noise_map=noise_map_0)
    analysis_1 = Analysis(data=data_1, noise_map=noise_map_1)

    # This means the model is fitted to both datasets simultaneously.

    analysis = analysis_0 + analysis_1

    # summing a list of analysis objects is also a valid API:

    analysis = sum([analysis_0, analysis_1])

By summing analysis objects the log likelihood values computed by the ``log_likelihood_function`` of each individual
analysis class are summed to give an overall log likelihood value that the non-linear search samples when model-fitting.

.. note::

    In the simple example above, instances of the same ``Analysis`` class (``analysis_0`` and ``analysis_1``) were
summed. However, different ``Analysis`` classes can also be summed together. This is useful when fitting different
datasets that each require a unique ``log_likelihood_function`` to be fitted simultaneously. For more detailed
information and a dedicated API for customizing how the model changes across different datasets, refer to
the [multiple datasets cookbook](https://pyautofit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/cookbooks/multiple_datasets.html).
