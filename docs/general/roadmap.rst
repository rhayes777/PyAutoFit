Road Map
========

**PyAutoFit** is in active development and the road-map of features currently planned in the short and long term are
listed and described below:

**JAX:**

Supported for autodiff is nearly implemented, including JAX fits.

**Non-Linear Searches:**

We are always striving to add new non-linear searches to **PyAutoFit*. In the short term, we aim to provide a wrapper to the many method available in the ``scipy.optimize`` library with support for outputting results to hard-disk.

If you would like to see a non-linear search implemented in **PyAutoFit** please `raise an issue on GitHub <https://github.com/rhayes777/PyAutoFit/issues>`_!

**Approximate Bayesian Computation**

Approximate Bayesian Computational (ABC) allows for one to infer parameter values for likelihood functions that are
intractable, by simulating many datasets and extracting from them a summary statistic that is compared to the
observed dataset.

ABC in **PyAutoFit** will be closely tied to the Database tools, ensuring that the simulation, fitting and extraction
of summary statistics can be efficiently scaled up to extremely large datasets.
