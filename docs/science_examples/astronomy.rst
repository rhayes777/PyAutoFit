Astronomy
=========

This example illustrates model-component and fitting for an Astronomy science case, based are the phenomena
of strong gravitational lensing. This is the science case that sparked the development of **PyAutoFit** as a spin
off of our astronomy software `PyAutoLens <https://github.com/Jammy2211/PyAutoLens>`_.

The schematic below depicts a strong gravitational lens:

A strong gravitational lens is a system consisting of multiple galaxy's down the light-of-sight to earth. To model
a strong lens, we ray-trace the traversal of light throughout the Universe so as to fit it to imaging data of a strong
lens. The amount light is deflected by is defined by the distances between each galaxy, which is called their redshift.

Multi-Level Models
------------------

We therefore need a model which contains separate model-components for every galaxy, and where each galaxy contains
separate model-components describing its light and mass. A multi-level representation of this model is as follows:

  :alt: Alternative text

The image above shows that we need a model consisting of individual model-components for:

 1) The lens galaxy's *light* and *mass*.
 2) The source galaxy's *light*.

We also need each galaxy to be a **model-component** itself and for each of them to contain an additional parameter,
its ``redshift``. The galaxies can then be combined into an overall model for the strong lens system.

Model Example
-------------

To model the light of a galaxy, we define a ``LightProfile`` as a Python class, which behaves in the same way as
the ``Gaussian`` used in other **PyAutoFit** tutorials:

.. code-block:: python

    class LightProfile:

        def __init__(
            self,
            centre: typing.Tuple[float, float] = (0.0, 0.0),
            normalization: float = 0.1,
            radius: float = 0.6,
        ):
            """
            A light profile used in Astronomy to represent the surface brightness distribution of galaxies.

            Parameters
            ----------
            centre
                The (y,x) coordinates of the profile centre.
            normalization
                Overall normalization normalisation of the light profile.
            radius
                The circular radius containing half the light of this profile.
            """

            self.centre = centre
            self.normalization = normalization
            self.effective_radius = effective_radius

        def image_from_grid(self, grid: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:
            """This function creates an image of the light profile, which is used in strong lens model-fitting"""
            ...

We have omitted the code that creates the image from the light profile as we want to focus purely on multi-level model
composition with **PyAutoFit**.

We also define a ``MassProfile``:

.. code-block:: python

    class MassProfile:
        def __init__(
            self,
            centre: typing.Tuple[float, float] = (0.0, 0.0),
            mass: float = 1.0,
        ):
            """
            A mass profile used in Astronomy to represent the mass distribution of galaxies.

            Parameters
            ----------
            centre
                The (y,x) coordinates of the profile centre.
            mass
                The mass normalization of the profile.
            """

            self.centre = centre
            self.mass = mass

        def deflections_from_grid(self, grid: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:
            """This function describes the deflection of light due to the mass, which is used in strong lens model-fitting"""
            ...

We have again omitted the code which computes how this mass profile deflects the path of light.

We now define a ``Galaxy`` object, which contains instances of light and mass profiles and its redshift (e.g. distance
from Earth):

.. code-block:: python

    class Galaxy:

        def __init__(
            self,
            redshift: float,
            light_profile_list: Optional[List] = None,
            mass_profile_list: Optional[List] = None,
        ):
            """
            A galaxy, which contains light and mass profiles at a specified redshift.

            Parameters
            ----------
            redshift
                The redshift of the galaxy.
            light_profile_list
                A list of the galaxy's light profiles.
            mass_profile_list
                A list of the galaxy's mass profiles.
            """

            self.redshift = redshift
            self.light_profile_list = light_profile_list
            self.mass_profile_list = mass_profile_list

        def image_from_grid(self, grid: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:
            """Returns the image of all light profiles."""
            ...

        def deflections_from_grid(self, grid: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:
            """Returns the deflection angles of all mass profiles."""
            ...

If we were not composing a model, the code below shows how one would create an instance of the foreground lens galaxy,
which in the image above contains a light and mass profile:

.. code-block:: python

    light = LightProfile(centre=(0.0, 0.0), normalization=10.0, radius=2.0)
    mass = MassProfile(centre=(0.0, 0.0), mass=0.5)

    lens = Galaxy(redshift=0.5, light_profile_list=[light], mass_profile_list=[mass])

The code creates instances of the ``LightProfile`` and ``MassProfile`` classes and uses them to create an
instance of the ``Galaxy`` class. This uses a **hierarchy of Python classes**.

Multi-level Model
-----------------

We can compose a multi-level model using this same hierarchy of classes, using the ``Model`` and ``Collection`` objects.

Lets first create a model of the lens galaxy:

.. code-block:: python

    light = af.Model(LightProfile)
    mass = af.Model(MassProfile)

    lens = af.Model(
        cls=Galaxy,
        redshift=0.5,
        light_profile_list=[light],
        mass_profile_list=[mass]
    )

Lets consider what the code above is doing:

1) We use a ``Model`` to create the overall model component. The ``cls`` input is the ``Galaxy`` class, therefore the overall model that is created is a ``Galaxy``.

2) **PyAutoFit** next inspects whether the key word argument inputs to the ``Model`` match any of the ``__init__`` constructor arguments of the ``Galaxy`` class. This determine if these inputs are to be composed as **model sub-components** of the overall ``Galaxy`` model.

3) **PyAutoFit** matches the ``light_profile_list`` and  ``mass_profile_list`` inputs, noting they are passed as separate lists containing ``Model``'s of the ``LightProfile`` and ``MassProfile`` classes. They are both created as sub-components of the overall ``Galaxy`` model.

4) It also matches the ``redshift`` input, making it a fixed value of 0.5 for the model and not treating it as a free parameter.

We can confirm this by printing the ``prior_count`` of the lens, and noting it is 7 (4 parameters for
the ``LightProfile`` and 3 for the ``MassProfile``).

.. code-block:: python

    print(lens.prior_count)
    print(lens.light_profile_list[0].prior_count)
    print(lens.mass_profile_list[0].prior_count)

The ``lens`` behaves exactly like the model-components we are used to previously. For example, we can unpack its
individual parameters to customize the model, where below we:

 1) Align the light profile centre and mass profile centre.
 2) Customize the prior on the light profile ``one``.
 3) Fix the ``one`` of the mass profile to 0.8.

.. code-block:: python

    lens.light_profile_list[0].centre = lens.mass_profile_list[0].centre
    lens.light_profile_list[0].one = af.UniformPrior(lower_limit=0.7, upper_limit=0.9)
    lens.mass_profile_list[0].one = 0.8

We can now create a model of our source galaxy using the same API.

.. code-block:: python

    source = af.Model(
        astro.Galaxy,
        redshift=1.0,
        light_profile_list=[af.Model(astro.lp.LightProfile)]
    )

We can now create our overall strong lens model, using a ``Collection`` in the same way we have seen previously.

.. code-block:: python

    model = af.Collection(galaxies=af.Collection(lens=lens, source=source))

The model contains both galaxies in the strong lens, alongside all of their light and mass profiles.

For every iteration of the non-linear search **PyAutoFit** generates an instance of this model, where all of the
``LightProfile``, ``MassProfile`` and ``Galaxy`` parameters of the are determined via their priors.

An example instance is show below:

.. code-block:: python

    instance = model.instance_from_prior_medians()

    print("Strong Lens Model Instance:")
    print("Lens Galaxy = ", instance.galaxies.lens)
    print("Lens Galaxy Light = ", instance.galaxies.lens.light_profile_list)
    print("Lens Galaxy Light Centre = ", instance.galaxies.lens.light_profile_list[0].centre)
    print("Lens Galaxy Mass Centre = ", instance.galaxies.lens.mass_profile_list[0].centre)
    print("Source Galaxy = ", instance.galaxies.source)

This model can therefore be used in a **PyAutoFit** ``Analysis`` class and ``log_likelihood_function``.

Extensibility
-------------

This example highlights how multi-level models can make certain model-fitting problem fully extensible. For example:

 1) A ``Galaxy`` class can be created using any combination of light and mass profiles. Although this was not shown
explicitly in this example, this is because it implements their ``image_from_grid`` and ``deflections_from_grid`` methods
as the sum of individual profiles.

 2) The overall strong lens model can contain any number of ``Galaxy``'s, as these methods and their redshifts are used
to implement the lensing calculations in the ``Analysis`` class and ``log_likelihood_function``.

Thus, for problems of this nature, we can design and write code in a way that fully utilizes **PyAutoFit**'s multi-level
modeling features to compose and fits models of arbitrary complexity and dimensionality.

To illustrate this further, consider the following dataset which is called a **strong lens galaxy cluster**:

.. image:: https://github.com/rhayes777/PyAutoFit/blob/main/docs/overview/image/cluster_example.jpg?raw=true
   :width: 600
   :alt: Alternative text

For this strong lens, there are many tens of strong lens galaxies as well as multiple background source galaxies.
However, despite it being a significantly more complex system than the single-galaxy strong lens we modeled above,
our use of graphical models ensures that we can model such datasets without any additional code development, for
example:

.. code-block:: python

    lens_0 = af.Model(
        Galaxy,
        redshift=0.5,
        light_profile_list=[af.Model(LightProfile)],
        mass_profile_list=[af.Model(MassProfile)]
    )

    lens_1 = af.Model(
        Galaxy,
        redshift=0.5,
        light_profile_list=[af.Model(LightProfile)],
        mass_profile_list=[af.Model(MassProfile)]
    )

    source_0 = af.Model(
        astro.Galaxy,
        redshift=1.0,
        light_profile_list=[af.Model(LightProfile)]
    )

    # ... repeat for desired model complexity ...

    model = af.Collection(
        galaxies=af.Collection(
            lens_0=lens_0,
            lens_1=lens_1,
            source_0=source_0,
            # ... repeat for desired model complexity ...
        )
    )

Here is an illustration of this model's graph:

.. image:: https://github.com/rhayes777/PyAutoFit/blob/main/docs/overview/image/lens_model_cluster.png?raw=true

**PyAutoFit** therefore gives us full control over the composition and customization of high dimensional graphical
models.
