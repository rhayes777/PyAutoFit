Overview
========

**PyAutoFit** requires Python 3.6+ and support the Linux, MacOS and Windows operating systems.

**PyAutoLens** can be installed via the Python distribution `Anaconda <https://www.anaconda.com/>`_ or using
`Pypi <https://pypi.org/>`_ to ``pip install`` **PyAutoLens** into your Python distribution.

We recommend Anaconda as it manages the installation of many major libraries used by **PyAutoLens** (e.g. numpy, scipy,
matplotlib, etc.) making installation more straight forward.

The installation guide for both approaches can be found at:

- `Anaconda installation guide <https://pyautofit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation/conda.html>`_

- `PyPI installation guide <https://pyautofit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation/pip.html>`_

Users who wish to build **PyAutoFit** from source (e.g. via a `git clone`) should follow
our `building from source installation guide <https://pyautofit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation/source.html>`_.
