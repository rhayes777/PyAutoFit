Sensitivity Mapping
===================

Bayesian model comparison allows us to take a dataset, fit it with multiple models and use the Bayesian evidence to
quantify which model objectively gives the best-fit following the principles of Occam's Razor.

However, a complex model may not be favoured by model comparison not because it is the 'wrong' model, but simply
because the dataset being fitted is not of a sufficient quality for the more complex model to be favoured. Sensitivity
mapping addresses what quality of data would be needed for the more complex model to be favoured.

In order to do this, sensitivity mapping involves us writing a function that uses the model(s) to simulate a dataset.
We then use this function to simulate many datasets, for many different models, and fit each dataset using the same
model-fitting procedure we used to perform Bayesian model comparison. This allows us to infer how much of a Bayesian
evidence increase we should expect for datasets of varying quality and / or models with different parameters.

Data
----

To illustrate sensitivity mapping we will again use the example of fitting 1D Gaussian's in noisy data. This 1D data
includes a small feature to the right of the central ``Gaussian``, a second ``Gaussian`` centred on pixel 70.

Model Comparison
----------------

Before performing sensitivity mapping, we will quickly perform Bayesian model comparison on this data to get a sense
for whether the ``Gaussian`` feature is detectable and how much the Bayesian evidence increases when it is included in
the model.

We therefore fit the data using two models, one where the model is a single ``Gaussian``.

.. code-block:: bash

    model = af.Collection(gaussian_main=m.Gaussian)

    search = af.DynestyStatic(
        path_prefix=path.join("features", "sensitivity_mapping", "single_gaussian"),
        nlive=100,
        iterations_per_update=500,
    )

    result_single = search.fit(model=model, analysis=analysis)

For the second model it contains two ``Gaussians``. To avoid slow model-fitting and more clearly pronounce the results of
model comparison, we restrict the centre of the ``gaussian_feature`` to its true centre of 70 and sigma value of 0.5.

.. code-block:: bash

    model = af.Collection(gaussian_main=m.Gaussian, gaussian_feature=m.Gaussian)
    model.gaussian_feature.centre = 70.0
    model.gaussian_feature.sigma = 0.5

    search = af.DynestyStatic(
        path_prefix=path.join("features", "sensitivity_mapping", "two_gaussians"),
        nlive=100,
        iterations_per_update=500,
    )

    result_multiple = search.fit(model=model, analysis=analysis)

We can now print the ``log_evidence`` of each fit and confirm the model with two ``Gaussians`` was preferred to the model
with just one ``Gaussian``.

.. code-block:: bash

    print(result_single.samples.log_evidence)
    print(result_multiple.samples.log_evidence)

On my laptop, the increase in Bayesian evidence for the more compelx model is ~30, which is significant.

The model comparison above shows that in this dataset, the ``Gaussian`` feature was detectable and that it increased the
Bayesian evidence by ~25. Furthermore, the normalization of this ``Gaussian`` was ~0.3.

A lower value of normalization makes the ``Gaussian`` fainter and harder to detect. We will demonstrate sensitivity mapping
by answering the following question, at what value of normalization does the ``Gaussian`` feature become undetectable and
not provide us with a noticeable increase in Bayesian evidence?

Base Model
----------

To begin, we define the ``base_model`` that we use to perform sensitivity mapping. This model is used to simulate every
dataset. It is also fitted to every simulated dataset without the extra model component below, to give us the Bayesian
evidence of the every simpler model to compare to the more complex model.

The ``base_model`` corresponds to the ``gaussian_main`` above.

.. code-block:: bash

    base_model = af.Collection(gaussian_main=m.Gaussian)

Perturbation Model
------------------

We now define the ``perturb_model``, which is the model component whose parameters we iterate over to perform
sensitivity mapping. Many instances of the ``perturb_model`` are created and used to simulate the many datasets
that we fit. However, it is only included in half of the model-fits corresponding to the more complex models whose
Bayesian evidence we compare to the simpler model-fits consisting of just the ``base_model``.

The ``perturb_model`` is therefore another ``Gaussian`` but now corresponds to the ``gaussian_feature`` above.

By fitting both of these models to every simulated dataset, we will therefore infer the Bayesian evidence of every
model to every dataset. Sensitivity mapping therefore maps out for what values of ``normalization`` in the ``gaussian_feature``
does the more complex model-fit provide higher values of Bayesian evidence than the simpler model-fit. We also fix the
values ot the ``centre`` and ``sigma`` of the ``Gaussian`` so we only map over its ``normalization``.

.. code-block:: bash

    perturb_model = af.Model(m.Gaussian)
    perturb_model.centre = 70.0
    perturb_model.sigma = 0.5
    perturb_model.normalization = af.UniformPrior(lower_limit=0.01, upper_limit=100.0)

Simulation
----------

We are performing sensitivity mapping to determine how bright the ``gaussian_feature`` needs to be in order to be
detectable. However, every simulated dataset must include the ``main_gaussian``, as its presence in the data will effect
the detectability of the ``gaussian_feature``.

We can pass the ``main_gaussian`` into the sensitivity mapping as the ``simulation_instance``, meaning that it will be used
in the simulation of every dataset. For this example we use the inferred ``main_gaussian`` from one of the model-fits
performed above.

.. code-block:: bash

    simulation_instance = result_single.instance

We now write the ``simulate_cls``, which takes the ``instance`` of our model (defined above) and uses it to
simulate a dataset which is subsequently fitted.

Note that when this dataset is simulated, the quantity ``instance.perturb`` is used in the ``simulate_cls``.
This is an instance of the ``gaussian_feature``, and it is different every time the ``simulate_cls`` is called.

In this example, this ``instance.perturb`` corresponds to different ``gaussian_feature``'s with values of
``normalization`` ranging over 0.01 -> 100.0, such that our simulated datasets correspond to a very faint and very bright
gaussian features.

.. code-block:: bash

    def __call__(instance, simulate_path):

        """
        Specify the number of pixels used to create the xvalues on which the 1D line of the profile is generated using and
        thus defining the number of data-points in our data.

        pixels = 100
        xvalues = np.arange(pixels)

        """
        Evaluate the ``Gaussian`` and Exponential model instances at every xvalues to create their model profile and sum
        them together to create the overall model profile.

        This print statement will show that, when you run ``Sensitivity`` below the values of the perturbation use fixed
        values of ``centre=70`` and ``sigma=0.5``, whereas the normalization varies over the ``step_size`` based on its prior.
        """

        print(instance.perturb.centre)
        print(instance.perturb.normalization)
        print(instance.perturb.sigma)

        model_line = instance.gaussian_main.model_data_1d_via_xvalues_from(xvalues=xvalues) + instance.perturb.model_data_1d_via_xvalues_from(xvalues=xvalues)

        """Determine the noise (at a specified signal to noise level) in every pixel of our model profile."""
        signal_to_noise_ratio = 25.0
        noise = np.random.normal(0.0, 1.0 / signal_to_noise_ratio, pixels)

        """
        Add this noise to the model line to create the line data that is fitted, using the signal-to-noise ratio to compute

        """
        data = model_line + noise
        noise_map = (1.0 / signal_to_noise_ratio) * np.ones(pixels)

        return Imaging(data=data, noise_map=noise_map)

Summary
-------

We can now combine all of the objects created above and perform sensitivity mapping. The inputs to the ``Sensitivity``
object below are:

- ``simulation_instance``: This is an instance of the model used to simulate every dataset that is fitted. In this example it contains an instance of the ``gaussian_main`` model component.

- ``base_model``: This is the simpler model that is fitted to every simulated dataset, which in this example is composed of a single ``Gaussian`` called the ``gaussian_main``.

- ``perturb_model``: This is the extra model component that alongside the ``base_model`` is fitted to every simulated dataset, which in this example  is composed of two ``Gaussians`` called the ``gaussian_main`` and ``gaussian_feature``.

- ``simulate_cls``: This is the function that uses the ``instance`` and many instances of the ``perturb_model`` to simulate many datasets that are fitted with the ``base_model`` and ``base_model`` + ``perturb_model``.

- ``step_size``: The size of steps over which the parameters in the ``perturb_model`` are iterated. In this example, normalization has a ``LogUniformPrior`` with lower limit 1e-4 and upper limit 1e2, therefore the ``step_size`` of 0.5 will simulate and fit just 2 datasets where the normalization is 1e-4 and 1e2.

- ``number_of_cores``: The number of cores over which the sensitivity mapping is performed, enabling parallel processing.

(Note that for brevity we have omitted a couple of extra inputs in this example, which can be found by going to the
full example script on the ``autofit_workspace``).

.. code-block:: bash

    sensitivity = s.Sensitivity(
        search=search,

        simulate_cls=simulate_cls,
        analysis_class=Analysis,
        step_size=0.5,
        number_of_cores=2,
    )

    sensitivity_result = sensitivity.run()

Here are what the fits to the two most extreme simulated datasets look like, for the models including the Gaussian
feature.

The key point to note is that for every dataset, we now have a model-fit with and without the model ``perturbation``. By
compairing the Bayesian evidence of every pair of fits for every value of ``normalization`` we are able to determine when
our model was sensitivity to the ``Gaussian`` feature and therefore could detect it!
