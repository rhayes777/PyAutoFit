Analysis
========

The ``Analysis`` class is the interface between the data and model, whereby a ``log_likelihood_function`` is defined
and called by the non-linear search to fit the model.

This cookbook provides an overview of how to use and extend ``Analysis`` objects in **PyAutoFit**.

**Contents:**

- **Example**: A simple example of an analysis class which can be adapted for you use-case.
- **Customization**: Customizing an analysis class with different data inputs and editing the ``log_likelihood_function``.
- **Visualization**: Using a `visualize` method so that model-specific visuals are output to hard-disk.
- **Custom Result**: Return a custom Result object with methods specific to your model fitting problem.
- **Latent Variables**: Adding a `compute_latent_variable` method to the analysis to output latent variables to hard-disk.
- **Custom Output**: Add methods which output model-specific results to hard-disk in the ``files`` folder (e.g. as .json files) to aid in the interpretation of results.

Example
-------

An example simple ``Analysis`` class, to remind ourselves of the basic structure and inputs.

This can be adapted for your use case.

.. code-block:: python

    class Analysis(af.Analysis):
        def __init__(self, data: np.ndarray, noise_map: np.ndarray):
            """
            The `Analysis` class acts as an interface between the data and model in **PyAutoFit**.

            Its `log_likelihood_function` defines how the model is fitted to the data and it is
            called many times by the non-linear search fitting algorithm.

            In this example the `Analysis` `__init__` constructor only contains the `data`
            and `noise-map`, but it can be easily extended to include other quantities.

            Parameters
            ----------
            data
                A 1D numpy array containing the data (e.g. a noisy 1D signal) fitted in the
                workspace examples.
            noise_map
                A 1D numpy array containing the noise values of the data, used for computing
                the goodness of fit metric, the log likelihood.
            """
            super().__init__()

            self.data = data
            self.noise_map = noise_map

        def log_likelihood_function(self, instance) -> float:
            """
            Returns the log likelihood of a fit of a 1D Gaussian to the dataset.

            The data is fitted using an `instance` of the `Gaussian` class where
            its `model_data_1d_via_xvalues_from` is called in order to create a
            model data representation of the Gaussian that is fitted to the data.
            """

            xvalues = np.arange(self.data.shape[0])

            model_data = instance.model_data_1d_via_xvalues_from(xvalues=xvalues)

            residual_map = self.data - model_data
            chi_squared_map = (residual_map / self.noise_map) ** 2.0
            chi_squared = sum(chi_squared_map)
            noise_normalization = np.sum(np.log(2 * np.pi * self.noise_map ** 2.0))
            log_likelihood = -0.5 * (chi_squared + noise_normalization)

            return log_likelihood

An instance of the analysis class is created as follows.

.. code-block:: python

    dataset_path = path.join("dataset", "example_1d", "gaussian_x1")
    data = af.util.numpy_array_from_json(file_path=path.join(dataset_path, "data.json"))
    noise_map = af.util.numpy_array_from_json(
        file_path=path.join(dataset_path, "noise_map.json")
    )

    analysis = Analysis(data=data, noise_map=noise_map)

Customization
-------------

The ``Analysis`` class can be fully customized to be suitable for your model-fit.

For example, additional inputs can be included in the ``__init__`` constructor and used in the ``log_likelihood_function``.
if they are required for your ``log_likelihood_function`` to work.

The example below includes three additional inputs:

- Instead of inputting a ``noise_map``, a ``noise_covariance_matrix`` is input, which means that corrrlated noise is
   accounted for in the ``log_likelihood_function``.

- A ``mask`` is input which masks the data such that certain data points are omitted from the log likelihood

- A ``kernel`` is input which can account for certain blurring operations during data acquisition.

.. code-block:: python

    class Analysis(af.Analysis):
        def __init__(
                self,

                in the workspace examples.
            noise_covariance_matrix
                A 2D numpy array containing the noise values and their covariances
                for the data, used for computing the
                goodness of fit whilst accounting for correlated noise.
            mask
                A 1D numpy array containing a mask, where `True` values mean a data
                point is masked and is omitted from
                the log likelihood.
            kernel
                A 1D numpy array containing the blurring kernel of the data, used

            The key point is that any inputs required to compute the log
            likelihood can be passed into the `__init__` constructor of the
            `Analysis` class and used in the `log_likelihood_function`.

    )

Visualization
-------------

If a ``name`` is input into a non-linear search, all results are output to hard-disk in a folder.

By overwriting the ``Visualizer`` object of an ``Analysis`` class with a custom ``Visualizer`` class, custom results of the
model-fit can be visualized during the model-fit.

The ``Visualizer`` below has the methods ``visualize_before_fit`` and ``visualize``, which perform model specific
visualization will also be output into an ``image`` folder, for example as ``.png`` files.

This uses the maximum log likelihood model of the model-fit inferred so far.

Visualization of the results of the search, such as the corner plot of what is called the "Probability Density
Function", are also automatically output during the model-fit on the fly.

.. code-block:: python

     class Visualizer(af.Visualizer):

        @staticmethod
        def visualize_before_fit(

            which is used to perform the visualization (e.g. it contains the data and noise map which are plotted).

            This can output visualization of quantities which do not change during the model-fit, for example the
            data and noise-map.

            by the non-linear search `name` and other inputs.

Custom Result
-------------

The ``Result`` object is returned by a non-linear search after running the following code:

.. code-block:: python

    result = search.fit(model=model, analysis=analysis)

The result can be can be customized to include additional information about the model-fit that is specific to your 
model-fitting problem.

For example, for fitting 1D profiles, the ``Result`` could include the maximum log likelihood model 1D data: 

.. code-block:: python

    print(result.max_log_likelihood_model_data_1d)

In other examples, this quantity has been manually computed after the model-fit has completed.

The custom result API allows us to do this. First, we define a custom ``Result`` class, which includes the property
``max_log_likelihood_model_data_1d``.

.. code-block:: python

    class ResultExample(af.Result):
    
        @property
        def max_log_likelihood_model_data_1d(self) -> np.ndarray:
            """
            Returns the maximum log likelihood model's 1D model data.
    
            This is an example of how we can pass the `Analysis` class a custom `Result` object and extend this result
            object with new properties that are specific to the model-fit we are performing.

            xvalues = np.arange(self.analysis.data.shape[0])
            
            return self.instance.model_data_1d_via_xvalues_from(instance=xvalues)

The custom result has access to the analysis class, meaning that we can use any of its methods or properties to 
compute custom result properties.

To make it so that the ``ResultExample`` object above is returned by the search we overwrite the ``Result`` class attribute 
of the ``Analysis`` and define a ``make_result`` object describing what we want it to contain:

For the sake of brevity, we do not run the code below, but the following code would work:

.. code-block:: python

    result = search.fit(model=model, analysis=analysis)
    print(result.max_log_likelihood_model_data_1d)

Latent Variables
----------------

A latent variable is not a model parameter but can be derived from the model. Its value and errors may be of interest
and aid in the interpretation of a model-fit.

For example, for the simple 1D Gaussian example, it could be the full-width half maximum (FWHM) of the Gaussian.
This is not included in the model but can be easily derived from the Gaussian's sigma value.

By overwriting the Analysis class's ``compute_latent_variable`` method we can manually specify latent variables that
are calculated. If the search has a ``name``, these are output to a ``latent.csv`` file, which mirrors
the ``samples.csv`` file.

There may also be a ``latent.results`` and ``latent_summary.json`` files output. The ``output.yaml`` config file
contains settings customizing what files are output and how often.

.. code-block:: python

            By overwriting this method we can manually specify latent variables that are calculated and output to
            a `latent.csv` file, which mirrors the `samples.csv` file.

            In the example below, the `latent.csv` file will contain one column with the FWHM of every Gausian model
            sampled by the non-linear search.

            This function is called for every non-linear search sample, where the `instance` passed in corresponds to
            each sample.

            Parameters
            ----------
            instance
                The instances of the model which the latent variable is derived from.

            Returns
            -------
            A dictionary mapping every latent variable name to its value.

Outputting latent variables manually after a fit is complete is simple, just call
the ``analysis.compute_all_latent_variables()`` function.

For many use cases, the best set disables autofit latent variable output during a fit via
the ``output.yaml`` file and perform it manually after completing a successful model-fit. This will save computational
run time by not computing latent variables during a any model-fit which is unsuccessful.

.. code-block:: python

    analysis = Analysis(data=data, noise_map=noise_map)

    # You need to have run a fit to retrieve a result to do this.

    analysis.compute_all_latent_variables(samples=result.samples)

Analysing and interpreting latent variables is described fully in the result cookbook.

However, in brief, the `latent_samples` object is a `Samples` object and uses the same API as samples objects.

.. code-block:: python

    print(latent_samples.median_pdf().fwhm)

Custom Output
-------------

When performing fits which output results to hard-disc, a ``files`` folder is created containing .json / .csv files of
the model, samples, search, etc.

These files are human readable and help one quickly inspect and interpret results.

By extending an ``Analysis`` class with the methods ``save_attributes`` and ``save_results``,
custom files can be written to the ``files`` folder to further aid this inspection.

These files can then also be loaded via the database, as described in the database cookbook.
