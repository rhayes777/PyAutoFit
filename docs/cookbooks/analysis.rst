=======
The ``Analysis`` class is the interface between the data and model, whereby a ``log_likelihood_function`` is defined
and called by the non-linear search fitting to fit the model.

This cookbook provides an overview of how to use and extend ``Analysis`` objects in **PyAutoFit**.

**Contents:**

- **Example**: A simple example of an analysis class which can be adapted for you use-case.
- **Customization**: Customizing an analysis class with different data inputs and editing the ``log_likelihood_function``.
- **Visualization**: Adding a ``visualize`` method to the analysis so that model-specific visuals are output to hard-disk.
- **Custom Output**: Add methods which output model-specific results to hard-disk in the ``files`` folder (e.g. as .json files) to aid in the interpretation of results.

Example
-------

An example simple ``Analysis`` class, to remind ourselves of the basic structure and inputs.

This can be adapted for your use case.

.. code-block:: python

    class Analysis(af.Analysis):
        def __init__(self, data: np.ndarray, noise_map: np.ndarray):
            """
            The `Analysis` class acts as an interface between the data and model in **PyAutoFit**.

            Its `log_likelihood_function` defines how the model is fitted to the data and it is
            called many times by the non-linear search fitting algorithm.

            In this example the `Analysis` `__init__` constructor only contains the `data`
            and `noise-map`, but it can be easily extended to include other quantities.

            Parameters
            ----------
            data
                A 1D numpy array containing the data (e.g. a noisy 1D signal) fitted in the
                workspace examples.
            noise_map
                A 1D numpy array containing the noise values of the data, used for computing
                the goodness of fit metric, the log likelihood.
            """
            super().__init__()

            self.data = data
            self.noise_map = noise_map

        def log_likelihood_function(self, instance) -> float:
            """
            Returns the log likelihood of a fit of a 1D Gaussian to the dataset.

            The data is fitted using an `instance` of the `Gaussian` class where
            its `model_data_1d_via_xvalues_from` is called in order to create a
            model data representation of the Gaussian that is fitted to the data.
            """

            xvalues = np.arange(self.data.shape[0])

            model_data = instance.model_data_1d_via_xvalues_from(xvalues=xvalues)

            residual_map = self.data - model_data
            chi_squared_map = (residual_map / self.noise_map) ** 2.0
            chi_squared = sum(chi_squared_map)
            noise_normalization = np.sum(np.log(2 * np.pi * self.noise_map ** 2.0))
            log_likelihood = -0.5 * (chi_squared + noise_normalization)

            return log_likelihood

An instance of the analysis class is created as follows.

.. code-block:: python

    dataset_path = path.join("dataset", "example_1d", "gaussian_x1")
    data = af.util.numpy_array_from_json(file_path=path.join(dataset_path, "data.json"))
    noise_map = af.util.numpy_array_from_json(
        file_path=path.join(dataset_path, "noise_map.json")
    )

    analysis = Analysis(data=data, noise_map=noise_map)

Customization
-------------

The ``Analysis`` class can be fully customized to be suitable for your model-fit.

For example, additional inputs can be included in the ``__init__`` constructor and used in the ``log_likelihood_function``.
if they are required for your ``log_likelihood_function`` to work.

The example below includes three additional inputs:

- Instead of inputting a ``noise_map``, a ``noise_covariance_matrix`` is input, which means that corrrlated noise is
   accounted for in the ``log_likelihood_function``.

- A ``mask`` is input which masks the data such that certain data points are omitted from the log likelihood

- A ``kernel`` is input which can account for certain blurring operations during data acquisition.

        def __init__(
                self,

            data

                in the workspace examples.
            noise_covariance_matrix
                A 2D numpy array containing the noise values and their covariances
                for the data, used for computing the
                goodness of fit whilst accounting for correlated noise.
            mask
                A 1D numpy array containing a mask, where `True` values mean a data
                point is masked and is omitted from
                the log likelihood.
            kernel
                A 1D numpy array containing the blurring kernel of the data, used
                for creating the model data.

            The key point is that any inputs required to compute the log
            likelihood can be passed into the `__init__` constructor of the
            `Analysis` class and used in the `log_likelihood_function`.

    )

Visualization
-------------

If a ``name`` is input into a non-linear search, all results are output to hard-disk in a folder.

By extending the ``Analysis`` class with a ``visualize_before_fit`` and / or ``visualize`` function, model specific
visualization will also be output into an ``image`` folder, for example as ``.png`` files.

This uses the maximum log likelihood model of the model-fit inferred so far.

Visualization of the results of the search, such as the corner plot of what is called the "Probability Density
Function", are also automatically output during the model-fit on the fly.

Custom Output
-------------

When performing fits which output results to hard-disc, a ``files`` folder is created containing .json / .csv files of
the model, samples, search, etc.

These files are human readable and help one quickly inspect and interpret results.

By extending an ``Analysis`` class with the methods ``save_attributes_for_aggregator`` and ``save_results_for_aggregator``,
custom files can be written to the ``files`` folder to further aid this inspection.

These files can then also be loaded via the database, as described in the database cookbook.
