A description of the general.ini visualization config.

[general]
    backend -> str
        The matploblib backend used for visualization (see
        https://gist.github.com/CMCDragonkai/4e9464d9f32f5893d837f3de2c43daa4 for a description of backends).

        If you use an invalid backend for your computer, PyAutoLens may crash without an error or reset your machine.
        There may be no better way to find the right backend than simple trial and error. The following backends have
        worked for PyAutoLens users:

        TKAgg (default)
        Qt5Agg (works on new MACS)
        Qt4Agg
        WXAgg
        WX
        Agg (outputs to .fits / .png but doesn't'display figures during a run on your computer screen)
