The prior config files contain the default priors and related variables for every light profile and mass profile
when it is used as a model.

They appear as follows:

.. code-block:: bash

    Gaussian:
      centre:
        type: Uniform
        lower_limit: 0.0
        upper_limit: 100.0
        width_modifier:
          type: Absolute
          value: 20.0
        gaussian_limits:
          lower: -inf
          upper: inf

The sections of this example config set the following:

    type {Uniform, Gaussian, LogUniform}
        The default prior given to this parameter when used by the non-linear search. In the example above, a
        UniformPrior is used with lower_limit of 0.0 and upper_limit of 4.0. A GaussianPrior could be used by
        putting "Gaussian" in the "type" box, with "mean" and "sigma" used to set the default values. Any prior can be
        set in an analogous fashion (see the example configs).
    width_modifier
        When the results of a search are passed to a subsequent search to set up the priors of its non-linear search,
        this entry describes how the Prior is passed. For a full description of prior passing, checkout the examples
        in 'autolens_workspace/examples/complex/linking'.
    gaussian_limits
        When the results of a search are passed to a subsequent search, they are passed using a GaussianPrior. The
        gaussian_limits set the physical lower and upper limits of this GaussianPrior, such that parameter samples
        can not go beyond these limits.

The files ``template_module.yaml`` and ``TemplateObject.yaml`` give templates one can use to set up prior default
configs for your own model components.
