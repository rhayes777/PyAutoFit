        Track how many sweeps in a row a given factor's optimiser has *raised*.

        A single raise is survivable — the sweep continues on that factor's
        previous message. A factor that raises on *every* sweep is not going to
        start working, so once it has raised `max_consecutive_failures` times in
        a row there is nothing to gain by sweeping further: stop, warn, and let
        `run` return what it has. The result is still reported, but loudly
        qualified — see `_stale_factor_warnings`.

        Only raises are counted. A returned `StatusFlag.FAILURE` is an ordinary,
        recoverable outcome that EP absorbs by design — the Laplace optimiser
        returns one whenever its line search fails — and counting those would
        cut healthy fits short.

        Counting is per-factor and resets on any sweep that does not raise, so
        an intermittent failure (the observed case) never trips it.

        Warn about any factor whose message is still the one it started with.

        A per-factor failure count is not enough to detect this. When several
        factors raise, *nothing* in the mean field changes, so the KL step
        between sweeps is zero and `EPHistory` declares convergence — often
        within two sweeps, before any count reaches its threshold. The run then
        terminates "successfully" and the returned mean field holds the starting
        priors for those factors, dressed up as a posterior (PyAutoFit#1405).

        The result is still returned — callers with a partly-failed graph may
        well want the factors that did converge — but never quietly: these
        strings are logged as warnings and written into `ep_diagnostics.results`
        alongside the sigma-collapse warnings.

        The condition is deliberately narrow: a factor that raised, or whose
        update was skipped (failed line search, bad projection), at least once
        and *never once* updated. A factor that failed intermittently but landed
        at least one update has a real message and is not reported.

        The factor-level test cannot see a *partial* revert. On a hierarchical
        graph every projection may be `BAD_PROJECTION` with one variable — the
        parent scatter — reverted in each one, while the factor's mean and its
        per-dataset variables update: the factor counts as updated, so no line
        is emitted, yet the scatter's reported posterior is the hyper-prior it
        started with. That is the #1405 stale-scatter state this warning exists
        to catch, so a second pass reports every (factor, variable) pair whose
        variable never once changed.

        That pass works on *groups*, not individual factors: a
        `HierarchicalFactor` decomposes into one factor per drawn variable, all
        sharing its name, and the parent scatter's message is the product of
        every member's. One member moving it is enough for the reported
        posterior to be a posterior, so a variable is only named when no member
        of its group ever moved it. A group is skipped only when every one of
        its factors is already named at factor level above.

        Run the optimisation on an approximation of the model.

        Parameters
        ----------
        model_approx
            A collection of messages describing priors on the model's variables.
        max_steps
            The maximum number of steps prior to termination. Termination may also
            occur when difference in log evidence or KL Divergence drop below a given
            threshold for two consecutive optimisations of a given factor.
        log_interval
            How steps should we wait before logging information?
        visualise_interval
            How steps should we wait before visualising information?
            This includes plots of KL Divergence and Evidence.
        output_interval
            How steps should we wait before outputting information?
            This includes the model.results file which describes the current mean values
            of each message.
        max_consecutive_failures
            How many consecutive sweeps a single factor's optimiser may *raise*
            on before the fit is aborted. One raise is not fatal — the sweep
            continues on that factor's previous message — but a factor that
            raises every sweep would leave EP converging on a stale message and
            reporting success. A returned failure status (e.g. a failed line
            search) is not counted. Set to 0 to never abort.
