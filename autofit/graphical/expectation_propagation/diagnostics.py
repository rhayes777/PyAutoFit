Diagnostics and monitoring for expectation-propagation fits.

An EP fit is a sequence of per-factor updates to a global mean-field
approximation. This module records that sequence so it can be inspected
while the fit runs and analysed after it finishes:

- ``EPDiagnostics`` — collects one snapshot per factor update (status,
  factor log-evidence, KL step size, and every variable's mean/std) and
  writes them as machine-readable CSVs and a matplotlib evolution plot.
- ``mean_field_summary`` — a human-readable table of a mean field,
  suitable for printing at the end of any example or script.
- ``check_sigma_collapse`` — guards against two collapse pathologies.
  First, the one from PyAutoFit issue #1332 (F10): repeated undamped EP
  updates over-count shared information and every sigma collapses
  towards zero around the starting point (rather than the data).
  Second, the *hierarchical parent-scale* collapse of PyAutoFit issue
  #1405: the scale hyperparameter of a ``HierarchicalFactor``'s parent
  distribution settles near zero with an error bar that is
  over-confident only *relative to that mean* — reporting "no scatter"
  as a confident answer. The two need different tests; see
  ``check_sigma_collapse``.

Outputs written to the EP output folder by ``EPOptimiser`` when paths
are enabled:

- ``ep_history.csv`` — one row per factor update:
  ``step, factor, success, updated, flag, log_evidence, kl_divergence,
  reverted_variables``
- ``mean_field_history.csv`` — one row per (factor update, variable):
  ``step, factor, variable, mean, std``
- ``mean_field_evolution.png`` — per-variable mean ± std vs update.

    Detect the two EP collapse pathologies.

    **Sigma collapse (PyAutoFit #1332, F10).** Repeated undamped EP
    updates can over-count shared-variable information: every std
    shrinks monotonically towards zero around the *starting* means,
    while the KL convergence criterion never triggers. This check flags
    a variable when either:

    - its latest std is below ``std_floor``, or
    - its std has shrunk monotonically over its last ``monotone_steps``
      *updates* (steps at which it did not move are not counted — see
      ``_drop_consecutive_repeats``) *and* by more than a factor
      ``1 / shrink_factor`` overall.

    **Hierarchical parent-scale collapse (PyAutoFit #1405).** Both
    tests above are *absolute* and variable-agnostic, because #1332 is
    a pathology in which every std goes to zero. The parent scale of a
    ``HierarchicalFactor`` collapses in a different shape: its *mean*
    goes to ~0 while its std stays moderate in absolute terms and is
    over-confident only *relative to that mean* — a confident claim of
    "no scatter". Measured on the #1405 toy, the collapsed runs sit at
    mean 0.80 (std 0.11) and mean 0.0030 against a parent scale
    hyper-prior of mean 10, where healthy runs recover 9.1-12.8; an
    absolute std test cannot separate those, and does not fire on
    either. So for variables registered by
    ``EPDiagnostics.register_hierarchical_scales`` a variable is
