``EPOptimiser`` accepts ``af.Emcee()`` directly) and its ``optimise`` delegates here.

        Perform optimisation for expectation propagation. Currently only
        applicable for ModelFactors created by the declarative interface.

        1. Analysis and model classes are extracted from the factor.
        2. Priors are updated from the mean field.
        3. Analysis and model are fit as usual.
        4. A new mean field is constructed with the (posterior) 'linking' priors.
        5. Projection is performed to produce an updated EPMeanField object.

        Output directories are generated according to the factor and the number
        of the search. For example a factor called "factor" would output:

        factor/optimization_0/<identifier>
        factor/optimization_1/<identifier>
        factor/optimization_2/<identifier>

        For the first, second and third optimizations respectively.

        ----------
        factor_approx
            A collection of messages defining the current best approximation to
            some global model
        status

        Returns
        -------
        An updated approximation to the model having performed optimisation on
        a single factor.
