# `autofit.graphical` — the mathematics, exactly as implemented

This package fits **factor graphs** — joint models over many datasets
and/or shared parameters — using **expectation propagation (EP)**. This
document states the statistical machinery in formal equations, with each
equation anchored to the class or method that implements it, so that the
code can be verified against the math line-by-line (by a human or an AI
agent). It documents what the code *does*; design intent beyond that is
marked explicitly.

Notation: `a, b` index factors; `i, j` index variables; `η` are natural
parameters; `T(x)` sufficient statistics; `A(η)` the log-partition
function; `h(x)` the base measure.

---

## 1. The model

A factor graph over variables `x = (x₁, …, x_n)`:

    p(x) ∝ ∏ₐ fₐ(xₐ)                                                (1)

where `xₐ` is the subset of variables factor `a` touches. Factors are
`Factor` objects (`factor_graphs/factor.py`) wrapping arbitrary
callables; a `FactorGraph` (`factor_graphs/graph.py`) is their product.
Priors participate as factors of their own (`declarative/factor/prior.py`,
`MeanField.from_priors`): a prior is one more term in Eq. (1).

In the declarative interface (`declarative/`), each dataset contributes
an `AnalysisFactor` whose value is `Analysis.log_likelihood_function`,
and `FactorGraphModel` assembles Eq. (1) from those plus the prior
factors.

## 2. The approximating family

The approximation is fully factorised over both factors and variables
("mean field"):

    q(x) = ∏ₐ qₐ(x),      qₐ(x) = ∏ᵢ qₐᵢ(xᵢ)                        (2)

- `qₐᵢ` — one **message** per (factor, variable): an exponential-family
  distribution (`autofit/messages/`),

      qₐᵢ(x) = h(x) exp( ηₐᵢ · T(x) − A(ηₐᵢ) )                       (3)

- `MeanField` (`mean_field.py`) is one factor's `{Variable → message}`
  dictionary, i.e. one `qₐ`.
- `EPMeanField` (`expectation_propagation/ep_mean_field.py`) is the full
  `{Factor → MeanField}` map, i.e. `q(x)`.

Because messages are exponential-family, products and quotients are
sums and differences of natural parameters
(`MessageInterface.sum_natural_parameters`, message `__mul__` /
`__truediv__`; powers scale them, `AbstractMessage.__pow__`):

    ∏ₖ qₖ(x) ∝ h(x) exp( (Σₖ ηₖ) · T(x) )                            (4)

The global approximation to the posterior of `xᵢ` is the product of
every factor's message on it: `q(xᵢ) ∝ ∏ₐ qₐᵢ(xᵢ)`
(`EPMeanField.mean_field`).

Non-Gaussian priors (Uniform, LogUniform, LogGaussian) are represented
as a base `NormalMessage` composed with deterministic transforms
(`TransformedMessage`, `messages/composed_transform.py`); the message
algebra operates on the base-space natural parameters and the transform
stack maps to physical space. See the module docstring of
`composed_transform.py` for the composition-order convention.

## 3. One EP update

For each factor `a` in turn (`EPOptimiser.run`,
`expectation_propagation/optimiser.py`):

### 3.1 Cavity — `EPMeanField.factor_approximation`

Everything except factor `a`:

    q^{\a}(x) = ∏_{b ≠ a} q_b(x)          η_cav,i = Σ_{b≠a} η_{bi}   (5)

The code builds this as `MeanField({v: 1.0}).prod(*other_factor_fields)`
and packages `(factor, cavity_dist, factor_dist, model_dist)` into a
`FactorApproximation` (`mean_field.py`), where
`model_dist = factor_dist × cavity_dist` is the current full
approximation restricted to factor `a`'s variables.

### 3.2 Tilted distribution — the factor optimiser

The exact factor times the cavity:

    p̂ₐ(x) = fₐ(x) q^{\a}(x) / Ẑₐ ,   Ẑₐ = ∫ fₐ(x) q^{\a}(x) dx       (6)

`FactorApproximation.__call__` evaluates `log fₐ + log q^{\a}`. The
tilted distribution is then *fitted* by the factor's optimiser:

- **Sampling path** (`AbstractSearch.optimise`,
  `non_linear/search/abstract_search.py`): the cavity messages are
  installed as the model's priors (`prior.with_message`), a non-linear
  search (Dynesty, Nautilus, Emcee, …) samples Eq. (6), and the result
  is projected per §3.3.
- **Laplace path** (`LaplaceOptimiser`, `graphical/laplace/`):
  quasi-Newton ascent on `log p̂ₐ` (`newton.py`: BFGS/SR1 with Wolfe
  line search, `line_search.py`), then a Gaussian at the optimum whose
  covariance is the inverse of the **actual Hessian of `log p̂ₐ` at the
  mode**, assembled by central finite differences of the tilted gradient
  (`newton.finite_difference_hessian`; `hessian="fd"`, the default; step
  `fd_step` = 1e-2 × the mean-field std, floored at `fd_min_step`) and
  Cholesky-factorised as one full matrix so that the per-variable
  marginal blocks of its inverse are exact
  (`OptimisationState.inv_hessian_blocks` → `MeanField.from_opt_state`
  → `from_mode_covariance`, `from_mode` on each message). If the Hessian
  is not finite or not negative-definite at the mode — a boundary mode
  such as a scatter driven to zero — the update is *skipped* with
  `StatusFlag.BAD_PROJECTION` rather than written. Factors with more
  than `hessian_max_size` (default 64) flattened free parameters fall
  back, with a log line, to `hessian="quasi"`, which keeps the
  pre-2026-09 path (the quasi-Newton diagonal secant, refined at
  `n_refine` random draws from the mean field; not deterministic).
- **Exact path** (`ExactFactorFit`,
  `expectation_propagation/factor_optimiser.py`): if the factor is
  itself a message of the same family as the cavity
  (`Factor.has_exact_projection`), the tilted distribution is conjugate
  and the update is the closed-form natural-parameter sum — no sampler.
  `EPOptimiser.from_meanfield` auto-selects this path.

### 3.3 Projection (moment matching) — `AbstractMessage.project`

Find the family member closest to the tilted distribution in inclusive
KL:

    q* = argmin_q KL( p̂ₐ ‖ q )                                        (7)

For an exponential family this is **moment matching**:

    E_{q*}[ T(x) ] = E_{p̂ₐ}[ T(x) ]                                   (8)

Implemented as importance-weighted sample moments over the search's
weighted samples `{x_s, log w_s}`:

    E[T] ≈ Σ_s w̃_s T(x_s) / Σ_s w̃_s ,   w̃_s = exp(log w_s − max log w)  (9)

(`AbstractMessage.project`; the max-log-weight shift is the standard
numerical stabilisation, and the mean weight supplies the projection's
`log_norm`). `from_sufficient_statistics` then inverts Eq. (8) to
natural parameters per family. On the Laplace path the "projection" is
the Gaussian mode/covariance construction instead.

### 3.4 Factor update with damping — `MeanField.update_factor_mean_field`

Divide out the cavity and damp with `δ ∈ (0, 1]`:

    qₐ^new = (q*)^δ (qₐ^old)^{1−δ} / (q^{\a})^δ                       (10)

equivalently, an exponential moving average on natural parameters:

    ηₐ ← (1 − δ) ηₐ + δ ( η_{q*} − η_cav )                            (11)

`δ` is supplied by an `ApproxUpdater` (`optimiser.py`): `SimplerUpdater`
(one fixed value), `FactorUpdater` (per factor), or `DynamicUpdater`
(per variable, `δᵢ ∝ min_count / count(i)` — variables shared by more
factors update more slowly). `δ` may therefore be a scalar or a
per-variable `MeanField` of scalars.

The declarative API accepts this policy explicitly:

    factor_graph.optimise(
        optimiser,
        updater=af.SimplerUpdater(delta=0.5),
    )

`updater=None` is the default and preserves the existing undamped
`SimplerUpdater(delta=1.0)` behaviour. Damping is problem-dependent rather
than a universal convergence fix; in particular, it has worsened hierarchical
scale collapse in repeated-run diagnostics, so a damped configuration should
be validated across repeated fits.

**Invalid-projection fallback**: if the division produces an invalid
message (e.g. negative variance — possible because Eq. (10)'s
subtraction of natural parameters is not closed in the family),
`update_factor_mean_field` reverts the invalid parameters to the
previous message per-parameter (`update_invalid`) and flags
`StatusFlag.BAD_PROJECTION`.

**Failed factor update**: a factor's own optimiser may *raise* rather
than return — most commonly `InitializerException`, when EP has driven
the factor to a state where every drawn start point has the same figure
of merit. `factor_step` catches this, degrades to the factor's previous
message, and flags `StatusFlag.EXCEPTION`, so one bad factor costs one
sweep's update rather than the whole graph fit. This is distinct from a
*returned* `StatusFlag.FAILURE` (e.g. the Laplace optimiser's "line
search failed"), which EP absorbs routinely. A factor that raises on
every sweep is not going to start working, so after
`max_consecutive_failures` (default 3) consecutive raises on one factor
`run` stops sweeping early; only raises are counted, and the count
resets on any sweep that does not raise. Every raise is recorded in
`ep_history.csv` as an `EXCEPTION` row and logged as a warning.

**Skipped factor update**: an update whose optimiser returned
`success=False` (a failed line search), or whose Hessian at the mode is
not finite or not negative-definite (a boundary mode such as a scatter
driven to zero), is not written back: `optimise_approx` hands back the
mean field it was given, unchanged, and `update_factor_mean_field` then
returns the factor's previous message (`last_dist`) with `updated=False`
and the flag it arrived with — `FAILURE` from the line search, or
`BAD_PROJECTION` with a message naming the factor and the reason from
the Hessian check — plus a "factor update skipped" message. When the
projection succeeds but dividing out the cavity is invalid for *some*
variables (their marginal precision is below the cavity's), only those
variables revert to the previous message (`update_invalid`) and the
status names each of them with both precisions; the others update, so
the step is flagged `BAD_PROJECTION` but still counts as an update. When
*every* variable reverts, nothing moved: that is a skipped update rather
than an update, so a factor whose projection is rejected on every sweep
is named stale instead of passing silently. A skipped update does not
count towards `max_consecutive_failures` (only raises do), but a factor
that is skipped on every sweep never updates, and the **STALE FACTORS**
warning covers that case too.

The result is still returned in that state — a partly-failed graph may
still hold converged messages worth having — but never quietly. If
enough factors raise, *nothing* in the mean field changes, so the KL
step of Eq. (12) is zero and `EPHistory` declares convergence — in
practice within two sweeps, before any per-factor count reaches its
threshold — and the mean field holds the starting priors for those
factors. `run` therefore checks, once the sweeps are over, whether any
factor raised or was skipped on every sweep and never once updated, and
emits a **STALE FACTORS**
warning naming them: logged, and written into `ep_diagnostics.results`
beside the sigma-collapse warnings. Read that file before trusting a
mean field from a run that logged failures. A factor that failed
intermittently but landed at least one update is not stale and is not
reported.

### 3.5 Caveat — a hierarchical *scatter* cannot be projected by its mode

For a hierarchical factor `N(xᵢ | μ, σ)` the tilted density in `σ` is
proportional to `1/σ` at `xᵢ = μ`: it is unbounded as `σ → 0`, so its
*mode* sits at or near the boundary even when its *mean* does not, and
its posterior is strongly skewed. A mode-based (Laplace) projection of
`σ` therefore has no valid Gaussian to write: before 2026-09 the
secant "covariance" let it write one anyway, collapsing the scatter to
~0 with a tiny error (#1405); with the Hessian at the mode the update is
skipped or reverted instead, so the scatter stays near its prior with
an honest width (closed-form benchmark, seed 0: EP 9.4 ± 3.6 against
the exact 6.6 ± 2.9, inside the exact 5–95 % interval, where it used to
read 2e-4 ± 0). The parent **mean** and the per-dataset variables are
recovered. This is a property of projecting by the mode, not of the
implementation: a hand-rolled EP with the same Gaussian family
reproduces the stale-factor state under a Laplace projection (every
site update rejected, the scatter returned at its prior) and recovers the
closed form under moment matching
(`autofit_workspace_test/scripts/graphical/analytic_ep_minimal.py`,
autofit_workspace_test#91).

What to do with it:

- Trust EP for the parent **mean** and the per-dataset variables; read the
  hierarchical **scatter** from a joint sampler over
  `factor_graph.global_prior_model` (the `graphical/` pattern) before
  quoting it, or wait for a moment-matching projection of the
  hierarchical factor.
- Prefer a log-scale parameterisation of the scatter
  (`LogGaussianPrior`), whose tilted density is bounded, over a
  `GaussianPrior`/`TruncatedGaussianPrior` truncated at zero: it
  updates (benchmark: 23 of 25 updates succeed) though it still carries
  a bias (log σ 1.53 ± 0.39 vs 1.83 ± 0.36 exact).
- Read `ep_history.csv`: a hierarchical factor with zero `SUCCESS`
  updates has returned its prior, whatever the numbers look like; the
  STALE FACTORS warning names it.
- The achievable ceiling is not zero even for the right projection:
  moment matching of a Gaussian site onto the skewed `σ` posterior
  carries a bias of order `|Δmean|/std ≲ 0.08`, `|std/std_ref − 1| ≲ 0.15`
  on the closed-form benchmark (seeds 0–4). Judge any EP scatter against
  that, not against a sampler's digits.

The closed-form benchmark and its parity tables are the regression
check for this section:
`autofit_workspace_test/scripts/graphical/analytic_*.py`.

## 4. Convergence — `EPHistory` (`expectation_propagation/history.py`)

After each factor update the history records the new `EPMeanField`.
Termination when either:

    KL( q_t ‖ q_{t−1} ) = Σᵢ KL( q_t(xᵢ) ‖ q_{t−1}(xᵢ) ) < kl_tol     (12)

(`FactorHistory.kl_divergence`, summed per-variable via `MeanField.kl`;
default `kl_tol = 1e-1`), or the log-evidence change drops below
`evidence_tol`, or a user callback fires.

**KL direction contract**: `m.kl(other)` means `KL(m ‖ other)`. (As of
the 2026-07 audit, `NormalMessage` and `TruncatedNormalMessage` satisfy
this; `GammaMessage` and `BetaMessage` compute the reverse direction,
and `TruncatedNormalMessage` uses the untruncated formula — tracked in
issue #1332, findings F2/F6.)

## 5. Evidence — `EPMeanField.log_evidence`

The EP approximation to the model evidence factorises as:

    Zᵢ = ∫ ∏ₐ qₐᵢ(xᵢ) dxᵢ                       (per variable)        (13)
    Zₐ = Ẑₐ / ∏_{i ∈ a} Zᵢ                      (per factor)          (14)
    Z  = ∏ᵢ Zᵢ ∏ₐ Zₐ                                                  (15)

`Zᵢ` is computed in closed form from log-partitions
(`MessageInterface.log_normalisation`):

    log ∫ ∏ₖ qₖ = Σₖ (log hₖ − A(ηₖ)) − ( log h − A(Σₖ ηₖ) )          (16)

and the per-factor `Ẑₐ` is carried on `MeanField.log_norm` by the
projection: a search-driven factor update records the sampler's
log-evidence of the tilted fit there (`AbstractSearch.optimise` →
`MeanField.from_priors(..., log_norm=...)`).

All three legs of the 2026-07 audit's finding F7 (#1332) are now fixed:
(a) `MeanField.__truediv__`/`__pow__` propagate `log_norm` (#1351),
(b) the search-driven projection records `Ẑₐ` (this section),
(c) the truncated-normal log-partition is complete (#1345). Evidence-
correct model comparison additionally requires **nested-sampling factor
searches** — MCMC/MLE searches carry no evidence estimate and contribute
`log_norm = 0`.

## 6. Deterministic variables

Three composition mechanisms exist; they are **not** interchangeable.
**Decision (EP review Phase 5, #1336, 2026-07-10): keep all three —
no unification, no deprecation.** The trade-off users should choose by:
compound priors / shared variables are statistically *tighter* (the
relation holds exactly inside each factor), while `factor_out` trades
that exactness for modularity (the deterministic variable receives its
own messages and `q(z)` factorises from its parents). The declarative
surface for deterministic quantities is the explicit compound pattern
(e.g. `model.sigma * 2.355`), pinned by the seam tests (§8); the
`model.<property>` sugar from #1153 was deliberately retired.

1. **Graph-level deterministic variables**: `Factor(..., factor_out=v)`
   declares outputs computed by the factor
   (`FactorValue.deterministic_values`); the Laplace path maintains a
   separate curvature estimate for them
   (`quasi_deterministic_update`, `laplace/newton.py`), and their
   approximate distributions live in the cavity
   (`FactorApproximation.deterministic_dist`).
2. **Compound prior arithmetic** (`mapper/prior/arithmetic/`):
   deterministic relations expressed on priors at model-composition
   time (e.g. `prior_a * matrix + prior_b`).
3. **Free shared variables**: share a prior across factors and encode
   the relation inside the likelihood.

## 7. Parallel EP — `ParallelEPOptimiser`

All factor approximations for a sweep are built from the **same**
mean field, factor optimisations run in a process pool, and the updates
are applied sequentially afterwards. This is standard "parallel EP"
semantics: cavities within a sweep are stale relative to serial EP, so
serial and parallel runs converge along different trajectories (to the
same fixed points when EP converges).

## 8. The lowering contract (declarative → graph)

`autofit.graphical` is two layers: the **inner layer** above (factor
graphs, messages, EP updates — this document's §1–§7) and the
**declarative layer** (`declarative/`: `FactorGraphModel`,
`AnalysisFactor`, `HierarchicalFactor`) that scientists actually use.
This section is the seam contract: what every declarative concept
*lowers to* on the graph, and which inner-layer capabilities survive
the translation. When either layer changes, this table is the thing to
re-verify (see the seam tests in
`test_autofit/graphical/test_declarative_deterministic.py`).

| Declarative concept | Lowers to | Notes / invariants |
|---|---|---|
| `FactorGraphModel(*factors)` | `FactorGraph` = the product Eq. (1) | one graph; `mean_field_approximation()` builds the `EPMeanField` |
| `AnalysisFactor(prior_model, analysis, optimiser)` | one `Factor` whose value is `analysis.log_likelihood_function` on the instance built from its variables | carries its own tilted-fit optimiser (§3.2) |
| each free `Prior` | one graph `Variable` **and** one `PriorFactor` | priors are ordinary factors (§1); `PriorFactor` currently wraps the message's bound `factor` method, which strips the exact-update hooks — the conjugate update of §3.2 is *not* auto-selected declaratively (tracked: #1337 / plan #1338 WP1) |
| the *same prior object* assigned to several models | one shared `Variable` connecting those factors | this is how information flows between datasets |
| `optimise(..., updater=...)` | `EPOptimiser(updater=...)` | the supplied update policy survives lowering unchanged; omitting it preserves the undamped `delta=1.0` default |
| compound prior (`prior_a * x + prior_b`, `mapper/prior/arithmetic/`) | **no graph variable** — the arithmetic is evaluated at instance-creation inside every factor that references it; only its component priors are variables | the relation is enforced *exactly* inside each tilted fit (no extra approximation — cf. §6); consequently the compound quantity has no message, no marginal, no evidence contribution of its own. (A `model.<property>` sugar for building these was deliberately reverted in `be6411755`.) |
| `HierarchicalFactor` | one `Factor` per drawn variable (plus the distribution's parameter variables) | deliberate dimensionality choice |
| — (no declarative expression) | `Factor(..., factor_out=v)` graph-level deterministic variables (§6.1) | **not reachable** from the declarative layer, by design as of the 2026-07 review (Phase 5, #1336): it trades the exact in-factor relation for a factorised q(v) with messages |

Contract for contributors: a new statistical capability lands in the
inner layer **together with** its row in this table — either a
declarative expression, or an explicit "not exposed" entry with the
reason. Capabilities that exist below but are silently absent above
(the `PriorFactor` exact-hooks row) are the seam's known failure mode.
