"""
First-class latent-variable extension point and computation engine.

This module holds the two halves of PyAutoFit's latent-variable machinery,
extracted from ``Analysis`` so the concern is self-contained (mirroring how
``Visualizer`` and ``Result`` are declared on an ``Analysis``):

- :class:`Latent` — the user/library extension point. Declare it on an analysis
  as ``Latent = MyLatent`` (just like ``Visualizer = MyVisualizer``) and override
  :meth:`Latent.keys` / :meth:`Latent.variables` to define latent variables.
  Methods are ``@staticmethod`` taking ``analysis`` first, matching the
  ``Visualizer`` convention.

- :func:`latent_samples_from` — the batched evaluation engine (JAX vmap/jit or
  NumPy dispatch, global NaN masking + greedy salvage). ``Analysis.compute_latent_samples``
  is now a thin wrapper around it.

Backwards compatibility: the default :class:`Latent` delegates to the (now
legacy) ``Analysis.LATENT_KEYS`` / ``Analysis.compute_latent_variables`` /
``Analysis.LATENT_BATCH_MODE``, so analyses that still override those keep
working unchanged. New code should subclass :class:`Latent` instead.

    Subclass and override :meth:`keys` and :meth:`variables` to define a

    the ``analysis`` as their first argument, so per-fit state (e.g.

    Compute latent-variable samples for every posterior sample.

    A latent variable is not a free parameter of the model but can be derived
    from it; its values (with errors) are stored in ``latent/`` alongside
    ``samples.csv``. The latents to compute and how to compute them come from
    ``analysis.Latent`` (:meth:`Latent.keys` / :meth:`Latent.variables`).

    Compatible with NumPy and JAX: the per-sample computation is side-effect
    free, batched via ``jax.vmap`` or per-sample ``jax.jit`` (selected by
    ``Latent.BATCH_MODE``), and any NaN/Inf values are masked out globally
    (degenerate latents dropped; samples carrying a NaN in a surviving latent
    dropped; anti-correlated NaNs salvaged by sacrificing the worst-coverage
    latent rather than discarding everything).

    Returns ``None`` when no finite latent samples remain (or no latents are
    defined).

    ------

        back off disk from ``samples.csv``. If that file was never written --
        because ``output.yaml``'s ``samples: false`` (or ``general.yaml``'s
        ``samples_to_csv: false``) disabled it -- ``result.samples`` is ``None``
        and there is nothing to compute latents from. Latent computation needs
        the full sample list; ``samples_summary.json`` is not a substitute.
