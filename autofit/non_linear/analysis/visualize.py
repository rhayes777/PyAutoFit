        """
        Whether a visualize method should be called perform visualization, which depends on the following:

        1) If a model-fit has already completed, the default behaviour is for visualization to be bypassed in order
        to make model-fits run faster.

        2) If a model-fit has completed, but it is the final visualization output where `during_analysis` is False,
        it should be performed.

        3) Visualization can be forced to run via the `force_visualization_overwrite`, for example if a user
        wants to plot additional images that were not output on the original run.

        4) If the analysis is running a database session visualization is switched off.

        5) If PyAutoFit test mode is on visualization is disabled, irrespective of the `force_visualization_overwite`
        config input.

        Parameters
        ----------
        paths
            The PyAutoFit paths object which manages all paths, e.g. where the non-linear search outputs are stored,
            visualization and the pickled objects used by the aggregator output by this function.

        Returns
        -------
        A bool determining whether visualization should be performed or not.
