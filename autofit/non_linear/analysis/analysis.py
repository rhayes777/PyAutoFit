        by a user to return a user-defined result object, which can be extended with additional methods and attributes
        specific to the model-fit.

        The standard `Result` object may include:

        - The samples summary, which contains the maximum log likelihood instance and median PDF model.

        - The paths of the search, which are used for loading the samples and search internal below when a search
        is resumed.

        - The samples of the non-linear search (e.g. MCMC chains) also stored in `samples.csv`.

        - The non-linear search used for the fit in its internal representation, which is used for resuming a search
        and making bespoke visualization using the search's internal results.

        - The analysis used to fit the model (default disabled to save memory, but option may be useful for certain
        projects).

        Parameters
        ----------
        samples_summary
            The summary of the samples of the non-linear search, which include the maximum log likelihood instance and
            median PDF model.
        paths
            An object describing the paths for saving data (e.g. hard-disk directories or entries in sqlite database).
        samples
            The samples of the non-linear search, for example the chains of an MCMC run.
        search_internal
            The internal representation of the non-linear search used to perform the model-fit.
        analysis
            The analysis used to fit the model.

        Returns
        -------
