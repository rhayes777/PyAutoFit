        Manages the path structure for `NonLinearSearch` output, for analyses both not using and using the search
        API. Use via non-linear searches requires manual input of paths, whereas the search API manages this using the
        search attributes.

        The output path within which the *Paths* objects path structure is contained is set via PyAutoNerves, using the
        command:

        from autonerves import conf
        conf.instance = conf.Config(output_path="path/to/output")

        If we assume all the input strings above are used with the following example names:

        name = "name"
        path_prefix = "folder_0/folder_1"

        The output path of the `NonLinearSearch` results will be:

        /path/to/output/folder_0/folder_1/name

        If ``PYAUTO_TEST_MODE`` has an active level greater than zero, a
        ``test_mode`` segment is inserted directly after the output root:

        /path/to/output/test_mode/folder_0/folder_1/name

        This keeps smoke-test artefacts in a sibling tree so they
        cannot be picked up by a later real run with the same paths.

        Parameters
        ----------
        name
            The name of the non-linear search, which is used as a folder name after the ``path_prefix``. For searchs
            this name is the ``name``.
        path_prefix
            A prefixed path that appears after the output_path but before the name variable.
        is_identifier_in_paths
            If True output path and symlink path terminate with an identifier generated from the
            search and model
        parent
            The parent paths object of this paths object.
        unique_tag
            A unique tag for the search, used to differentiate between searches with the same name.
        identifier
            A custom identifier for the search, if this is not None it will be used instead of the automatically
            generated identifier
        image_path_suffix
            A suffix which is appended to the image path. This is used to differentiate between different
            image outputs, for example the image of the starting point of an MLE.

        Add a file (already inside this search's output directory) to the

        ``restore()`` deletes the output directory and re-extracts the zip, so
        any file written into e.g. ``files/`` *after* a search completed — such
        as a cache artifact derived from the finished result — would be
        destroyed by the next resume unless it is also a member of the zip.

        No-op when the zip does not exist (e.g. the search is still running,
        so the file will be zipped with everything else at completion) and
        when the archived member is already byte-identical to the file on
        disk. When the member exists but its content has changed — a cache
        that was invalidated and recomputed — it is replaced, otherwise the
        stale copy would come back at the next ``restore()``.

        Under ``remove_files`` the zip is the **only** store for a search:
        the output directory is deleted once the search is archived, so a
        loose copy left beside the zip is not a second home for the file but
        a directory that should not exist. It shadows the zip for
        ``Aggregator.from_directory``, which then sees a search output with
        no ``.completed`` file. The loose copy is therefore deleted once the
        member is in the archive, along with any parent directory that
        emptied as a result, and the cache it holds is recomputed the next
        time it is asked for. With ``remove_files`` unset the output
        directory is the primary store and the loose copy stays.

        Parameters
        ----------
        file_path
            Absolute path of the file to preserve; must live under
