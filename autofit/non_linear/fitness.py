        Interfaces with any non-linear in order to fit a model to the data and return a log likelihood via
        an `Analysis` class.

        The interface of a non-linear search and a fitness function can be summarized as follows:

        1) The non-linear search chooses a new set of parameters for the model, which are passed to the fitness
        function's `__call__` method.

        2) The parameter values (typically a list) are mapped to an instance of the model (via its priors if
        appropriate for the non-linear search).

        3) The instance is passed to the analysis class's log likelihood function, which fits the model to the
        data and returns the log likelihood.

        4) A final figure-of-merit is computed and returned to the non-linear search, which is either the log
        likelihood or log posterior depending on the type of non-linear search.

        It is common for nested sampling algorithms to require that the figure of merit returned is a log likelihood
        as priors are often built into the mapping of values from a unit hyper-cube. Optimizers and MCMC methods
        typically require that the figure of merit returned is a log posterior, with the prior terms added via this
        fitness function. This is not a strict rule, but is a good default.

        Some methods also require a chi-squared value to be computed (which is minimized), which is the log likelihood
        multiplied by -2.0. The `Fitness` class can also compute this value, if the `convert_to_chi_squared` bool is
        `True`.

        If a model-fit raises an exception of returns a `np.nan` a `resample_figure_of_merit` value is returned. The
        appropriate value depends on the non-linear search, but is typically either `None`, `-np.inf` or `1.0e99`.
        All values indicate to the non-linear search that the model-fit should be resampled or ignored.

        Parameters
        ----------
        analysis
            An object that encapsulates the data and a log likelihood function which fits the model to the data
            via the non-linear search.
        model
            The model that is fitted to the data, which is used by the non-linear search to create instances of
            the model that are fitted to the data via the log likelihood function.
        fom_is_log_likelihood
            If `True`, the figure of merit returned by the fitness function is the log likelihood. If `False`, the
            figure of merit is the log posterior.
        resample_figure_of_merit
            The figure of merit returned if the model-fit raises an exception or returns a `np.nan`.
        convert_to_chi_squared
            If `True`, the figure of merit returned is the log likelihood multiplied by -2.0, such that it is a
            chi-squared value that is minimized.
