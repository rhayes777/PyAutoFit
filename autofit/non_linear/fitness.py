    **Off by default.** The packaged ``general.yaml`` ships this blank, so the guard is disabled
    unless a config opts in. It is off because the ceiling is a bare magnitude in *unspecified
    units*: a log likelihood is ``-0.5 * chi_squared - 0.5 * noise_normalization``, and both terms
    scale with the noise map -- ``chi_squared`` as ``noise ** -2``, ``noise_normalization``
    linearly in the number of pixels. A dataset whose noise map is expressed in a small unit can
    therefore produce a *legitimate* log likelihood above any fixed threshold, and every model
    would be silently rejected, leaving the search nothing but the resample sentinel. The guard
    cannot tell that case from the one below, because a magnitude is the only signal it reads.

    What it exists for, when a config does opt in: `Fitness.call` maps ``NaN`` and ``inf`` log
    likelihoods to ``resample_figure_of_merit``, but a *finite* value of, say, ``3e+303`` passes
    straight through and the search accepts it as its best point. That is not hypothetical: a
    non-positive-definite regularization matrix makes an fp64 Cholesky return finite garbage, a
    nested sampler treats it as the peak of the posterior, its shell log evidence explodes to
    ``~1e56`` and the termination criterion never fires -- the run burns its wall clock without ever
    converging. `autolens_profiling` enables the ceiling for exactly this reason (run ``341908_5``);
    a science analysis should enable it only once its own units are known to be safe.

    The value is read **once** from
    ``conf.instance["general"]["test"]["log_likelihood_ceiling"]`` and returned as a static Python
    float, because the guard it feeds runs inside JAX-traced code, where a Python ``if`` on a traced
    value is illegal and the comparison must be a static-vs-traced ``xp.where``.

    A bare ``1e20`` in YAML parses as a *string*, not a float (PyYAML requires a decimal point or a
    signed exponent), so the value is coerced with ``float`` rather than trusted as read.

        Interfaces with any non-linear search to fit the model to the data and return a log likelihood via
        the analysis.

        The interface of a non-linear search and fitness function is summarised as follows:

        1) The non-linear search samples a new set of model parameters, which are passed to the fitness
        function's `__call__` method.

        2) The list of parameter values are mapped to an instance of the model.

        3) The instance is passed to the analysis class's log likelihood function, which fits the model to the
        data and returns the log likelihood.

        4) A final figure-of-merit is computed and returned to the non-linear search, which is either the log
        likelihood or log posterior (e.g. adding the log prior to the log likelihood).

        Certain searches (commonly nested samplers) require the parameters to be mapped from unit values to physical
        values, which is performed internally by the fitness object in step 2.

        Certain searches require the returned figure of merit to be a log posterior (often MCMC methods) whereas
        others require it to be a log likelihood (often nested samples which account for priors internally) in step 4.
        Which values is returned by the `fom_is_log_likelihood` bool.

        Some searches require a chi-squared value (which they minimized), given by the log likelihood multiplied
        by -2.0. This is returned by the fitness if the `convert_to_chi_squared` bool is `True`.

        If a model-fit raises an exception or returns a `np.nan`, a `resample_figure_of_merit` value is returned
        instead. The appropriate value depends on the search, but is typically either `None`, `-np.inf` or `1.0e99`.
        All values indicate to the non-linear search that the model-fit should be resampled or ignored.

        Many searches do not store the history of the parameters and log likelihood values, often to save
        memory on large model-fits. However, this can be useful, for example to plot the results of a model-fit
        versus iteration number. If the `store_history` bool is `True`, the parameters and log likelihoods are stored
        in the `parameters_history_list` and `figure_of_merit_history_list` attribute of the fitness object.

        Parameters
        ----------
        analysis
            An object that encapsulates the data and a log likelihood function which fits the model to the data
            via the non-linear search.
        model
            The model that is fitted to the data, which is used by the non-linear search to create instances of
            the model that are fitted to the data via the log likelihood function.
        paths
            The paths of the search, which if the search is being resumed from an old run is used to check that
            the likelihood function has not changed from the previous run.
        fom_is_log_likelihood
            If `True`, the figure of merit returned by the fitness function is the log likelihood. If `False`, the
            figure of merit is the log posterior.
        resample_figure_of_merit
            The figure of merit returned if the model-fit raises an exception or returns a `np.nan`.
        convert_to_chi_squared
            If `True`, the figure of merit returned is the log likelihood multiplied by -2.0, such that it is a
            chi-squared value that is minimized.
        store_history
            If `True`, the parameters and log likelihood values of every model-fit are stored in lists.

        This method is intended for internal use only.

        Model assertions (`AbstractPriorModel.add_assertion`) are enforced here too, and how
        depends on the backend. On numpy `instance_from_vector` raises a `FitException` and the
        `except` below returns `resample_figure_of_merit`. Under JAX a `raise` cannot happen
        inside a trace, so the instance is built with `ignore_assertions=True` and the assertions
        -- gathered from the whole model tree once, in `__init__`, so a child-attached assertion
        is enforced exactly as it is on numpy -- are instead evaluated as a **traced boolean** by
        `assertions_satisfied_from_vector` and applied with an `xp.where` to the **final figure of
        merit**, mapping a violating model to `resample_figure_of_merit`. Applying it at the end
        is what makes the two backends agree exactly: numpy returns its sentinel from an early
        `return`, before the log prior is added and before the chi-squared multiply. That
        makes the JAX path exception-free as required, at the cost of the same **value-only**
        caveat the NaN guards carry below: under `jax.grad` the `where` still differentiates the
        rejected branch. Whether the penalty is applied at all is a static Python bool decided in
        `__init__`, so the branch resolves at trace time under `jax.jit` / `jax.vmap`.

        The NaN/inf/magnitude guards below protect the **value only, never the gradient**.

        A model whose likelihood is NaN, inf, or larger in magnitude than `self.log_likelihood_ceiling` is mapped
        to `resample_figure_of_merit`, so searches that read only the figure of merit (nested samplers, MCMC) get
        the resample sentinel and never select the point. The magnitude ceiling exists because the NaN/inf checks
        miss the failure mode that actually kills long runs: an fp64 Cholesky on a non-positive-definite matrix
        returns *finite* garbage (log likelihoods up to `3e+303`), which a nested sampler happily accepts as its
        best point and then never terminates on. It is **off unless a config opts in** — the threshold is a bare
        magnitude and a log likelihood scales with the noise-map units, so a fixed ceiling can reject a legitimate
        fit (`get_log_likelihood_ceiling` carries the argument). It is a static Python float, so the default `inf`
        makes the `where` a no-op and the comparison stays legal under `jax.jit` / `jax.vmap`. When it does fire,
        the numpy path warns once per process; the traced paths cannot warn at all. Gradient
        consumers get no such protection: under `jax.grad`, reverse-mode differentiates *both* branches of an
        `xp.where` and multiplies the unselected one by zero, so if the likelihood's derivative is also non-finite
        the guard yields `0 * NaN = NaN` and the returned gradient is NaN even though the value looks handled.

        This bites only when the masked branch's *derivative* is non-finite — not merely its value. `sqrt(x)` at
        x < 0 and `cholesky(A)` for non-positive-definite `A` are NaN in both value and derivative, so they trigger
        it; `log(x)` at x < 0 is NaN in value but its derivative `1/x` stays finite, so it does not.

        A guard here **cannot** repair this. By the time this method receives `log_likelihood` the non-finite
        derivative is already recorded on the autodiff tape, and no transformation of the output can remove it —
        an output-side "double-where" does not work. Gradient-safety must be established at the site that creates
        the NaN, by never *evaluating* the offending operation at the invalid input.

        See autolens_workspace_developer#104, where this was diagnosed, and
        `autofit_workspace_test/scripts/jax_assertions/fitness_nan_gradient_contract.py`, which pins the behaviour
        described here.

        Invert the figure-of-merit convention to recover the log likelihood.

        Manage quick updates during the non-linear search.

        A "quick update" is a lightweight visualization of the current best-fit
        (maximum likelihood) model parameters. This provides fast feedback on the
        progress of the fit without waiting for the full analysis to complete.

        It does not require leaving the active non-linear search, and is
        therefore faster than the full analysis visualization.

        Workflow:
        ----------
        1. Track the number of likelihood evaluations since the last quick update.
        2. Identify the maximum log-likelihood from the current batch of evaluations.
           - If `log_likelihood` is an array (batched evaluations), find the best
             index with `argmax`.
           - If it’s just a scalar (single evaluation), treat it as one update.
        3. If a new maximum likelihood is found, update:
           - `self.quick_update_max_lh` (best log-likelihood value so far).
           - `self.quick_update_max_lh_parameters` (corresponding parameter vector).
        4. Once the number of evaluations exceeds
           `self.iterations_per_quick_update`, generate a quick visualization of
           the current max-likelihood model via
           `self.analysis.perform_quick_update()`.

        Parameters
        ----------
        parameters : array-like
            The parameter vectors evaluated in this batch. Shape is typically
            (n_batch, n_param).
        log_likelihood : float or array-like
            The corresponding log-likelihood(s). If batched, must have shape
            (n_batch,).

        Notes
        -----
        - Quick updates are optional and controlled by
          `self.iterations_per_quick_update`.
        - If the `analysis` class does not implement
          `perform_quick_update`, the update is silently skipped.
        - If the current maximum log likelihood parameters cannot be turned
          into a model instance (e.g. they are outside a model component's
          physical domain), the visual is skipped with a logged warning and
          the search continues -- a quick update never terminates a fit. The
          `model.results` text, which is formatted from the parameter vector
          alone, is still written.
        - This mechanism is intended for fast, coarse visualization only,
          not detailed science-quality outputs.

        """
        Changes to the PyAutoGalaxy source code may inadvertantly change the numerics of how a log likelihood is
        computed. Equally, one may set off a model-fit that resumes from previous results, but change the settings of
        the pixelization or inversion in a way that changes the log likelihood function.

        This function performs an optional sanity check, which raises an exception if the log likelihood calculation
        changes, to ensure a model-fit is not resumed with a different likelihood calculation to the previous run.

        If the model-fit has not been performed before (e.g. it is not a resume) this function outputs
        the `figure_of_merit` (e.g. the log likelihood) of the maximum log likelihood model at the end of the model-fit.

        If the model-fit is a resume, it loads this `figure_of_merit` and compares it against a new value computed for
        the resumed run (again using the maximum log likelihood model inferred). If the two likelihoods do not agree
        and therefore the log likelihood function has changed, an exception is raised and the code execution terminated.

        Parameters
        ----------
        paths
            certain searches the non-linear search outputs are stored,
            visualization, and pickled objects used by the database and aggregator.
        result
            The result containing the maximum log likelihood fit of the model.
