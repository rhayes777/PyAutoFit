        """
        Interfaces with any non-linear search to fit the model to the data and return a log likelihood via
        the analysis.

        The interface of a non-linear search and fitness function is summarised as follows:

        1) The non-linear search samples a new set of model parameters, which are passed to the fitness
        function's `__call__` method.

        2) The list of parameter values are mapped to an instance of the model.

        3) The instance is passed to the analysis class's log likelihood function, which fits the model to the
        data and returns the log likelihood.

        4) A final figure-of-merit is computed and returned to the non-linear search, which is either the log
        likelihood or log posterior (e.g. adding the log prior to the log likelihood).

        Certain searches (commonly nested samplers) require the parameters to be mapped from unit values to physical
        values, which is performed internally by the fitness object in step 2.

        Certain searches require the returned figure of merit to be a log posterior (often MCMC methods) whereas
        others require it to be a log likelihood (often nested samples which account for priors internally) in step 4.
        Which values is returned by the `fom_is_log_likelihood` bool.

        Some searches require a chi-squared value (which they minimized), given by the log likelihood multiplied
        by -2.0. This is returned by the fitness if the `convert_to_chi_squared` bool is `True`.

        If a model-fit raises an exception or returns a `np.nan`, a `resample_figure_of_merit` value is returned
        instead. The appropriate value depends on the search, but is typically either `None`, `-np.inf` or `1.0e99`.
        All values indicate to the non-linear search that the model-fit should be resampled or ignored.

        Many searches do not store the history of the parameters and log likelihood values, often to save
        memory on large model-fits. However, this can be useful, for example to plot the results of a model-fit
        versus iteration number. If the `store_history` bool is `True`, the parameters and log likelihoods are stored
        in the `parameters_history_list` and `figure_of_merit_history_list` attribute of the fitness object.

        Parameters
        ----------
        analysis
            An object that encapsulates the data and a log likelihood function which fits the model to the data
            via the non-linear search.
        model
            The model that is fitted to the data, which is used by the non-linear search to create instances of
            the model that are fitted to the data via the log likelihood function.
        paths
            The paths of the search, which if the search is being resumed from an old run is used to check that
            the likelihood function has not changed from the previous run.
        fom_is_log_likelihood
            If `True`, the figure of merit returned by the fitness function is the log likelihood. If `False`, the
            figure of merit is the log posterior.
        resample_figure_of_merit
            The figure of merit returned if the model-fit raises an exception or returns a `np.nan`.
        convert_to_chi_squared
            If `True`, the figure of merit returned is the log likelihood multiplied by -2.0, such that it is a
            chi-squared value that is minimized.
        store_history
            If `True`, the parameters and log likelihood values of every model-fit are stored in lists.

        """
        Changes to the PyAutoGalaxy source code may inadvertantly change the numerics of how a log likelihood is
        computed. Equally, one may set off a model-fit that resumes from previous results, but change the settings of
        the pixelization or inversion in a way that changes the log likelihood function.

        This function performs an optional sanity check, which raises an exception if the log likelihood calculation
        changes, to ensure a model-fit is not resumed with a different likelihood calculation to the previous run.

        If the model-fit has not been performed before (e.g. it is not a resume) this function outputs
        the `figure_of_merit` (e.g. the log likelihood) of the maximum log likelihood model at the end of the model-fit.

        If the model-fit is a resume, it loads this `figure_of_merit` and compares it against a new value computed for
        the resumed run (again using the maximum log likelihood model inferred). If the two likelihoods do not agree
        and therefore the log likelihood function has changed, an exception is raised and the code execution terminated.

        ----------
