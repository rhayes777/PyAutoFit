        """
        Stores all the input settings that are used in search's and their `fit functions.

        This is used for more concisely passing settings through pipelines written using the empirical Bayesian
        functionality.

        Parameters
        ----------
        path_prefix
            The prefix of folders between the output path and the search folders.
        unique_tag
            The unique tag for this model-fit, which will be given a unique entry in the sqlite database and also acts as
            the folder after the path prefix and before the search name. This is typically the name of the dataset.
        number_of_cores
            The number of CPU cores used to parallelize the model-fit. This is used internally in a non-linear search
            for most model fits, but is done on a per-fit basis for grid based searches (e.g. sensitivity mapping).
        session
            The SQLite database session which is active means results are directly wrtten to the SQLite database
            at the end of a fit and loaded from the database at the start.
        info
            Optional dictionary containing information about the model-fit that is stored in the database and can be
            loaded by the aggregator after the model-fit is complete.
        pickle_files
            Optional pickle files which are accessible via the database post model-fitting.
