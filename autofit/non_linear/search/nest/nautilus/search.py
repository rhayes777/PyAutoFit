    A `multiprocessing.Pool` wrapper handed to nautilus as its likelihood pool
    (`pool_l`), whose workers already hold the fitness function in a global set
    by `nautilus.pool.initialize_worker` at fork time.

    Nautilus calls `pool.map(self.likelihood, args)` (`nautilus/sampler.py`),
    which for a plain pool object makes `multiprocessing` pickle the bound
    `Fitness.call_wrap` — and therefore the whole analysis, dataset, PSF
    convolver, sparse operator and adapt images — into every task chunk, for
    every likelihood call. This class ignores the function it is mapped with
    and dispatches `likelihood_worker` instead, which reads the worker-global
    likelihood, exactly as nautilus does for a `pool=<int>` argument (#1547).

    It also carries a **dead-worker watchdog**. `multiprocessing.Pool` silently
    replaces a worker that dies (`Pool._maintain_pool` -> `_repopulate_pool`)
    but never re-issues the task that worker was running, so a plain
    `Pool.map` blocks forever and the whole fit hangs to the wall clock — RAL
    job 342351_0 burned 27 hours after two likelihood workers segfaulted
    (#1608, and the same mechanism as #1547). `map` therefore dispatches via
    `map_async` and polls; on every poll it checks the exit code of every
    worker captured at construction. A replacement restores the worker
    *count*, but the original worker stays dead, so the loss is detectable,
    and the fit fails with a diagnosable `SearchException` (naming the PID and
    the signal) in seconds instead of hanging.

        A Nautilus non-linear search.

        Nautilus is an optional requirement and must be installed manually via the command `pip install nautilus-sampler`.
        It is optional as it has certain dependencies which are generally straight forward to install.

        https://github.com/johannesulf/nautilus
        https://nautilus-sampler.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html

        Parameters
        ----------
        name
            The name of the search, controlling the last folder results are output.
        path_prefix
            The path of folders prefixing the name folder where results are output.
        unique_tag
            The name of a unique tag for this model-fit, which will be given a unique entry in the sqlite database
            and also acts as the folder after the path prefix and before the search name.
        n_live
            Number of live points used for sampling.
        n_batch
            Number of likelihood evaluations performed at each step.
        n_like_max
            Maximum number of likelihood evaluations before stopping.
        f_live
            Maximum fraction of evidence in the live set before terminating.
        n_eff
            Minimum effective sample size before stopping.
        iterations_per_full_update
            The number of iterations performed between update (e.g. output latest model to hard-disk, visualization).
        number_of_cores
            The number of cores sampling is performed using a Python multiprocessing Pool instance.

            Not used by expectation-propagation factor searches, which refuse
            `number_of_cores > 1` outright (`AbstractSearch.optimise`, human
            ruling 2026-09-09): a forked worker that dies is replaced by
            `multiprocessing.Pool` while its in-flight task is never re-issued,
            so the fit hangs instead of failing. EP parallelism comes from a
            JAX-vectorised likelihood (`Analysis(use_jax=True)`), which takes
            the pool-free `fit_x1_cpu` path.
        silence
            If True, the default print output of the non-linear search is silenced.
        force_x1_cpu
            If True, force single-CPU mode even when number_of_cores > 1.
        session
            An SQLalchemy session instance so the results of the model-fit are written to an SQLite database.

        # evaluations *and* for its own sampler calculations — in particular
        # neural bound training (`nautilus/neural.py`,
        # `NeuralNetworkEmulator.train` -> `pool.map`). A worker that dies
        # mid-fit (e.g. a per-job OOM kill on a cluster) is silently replaced
        # by `multiprocessing.Pool`, but the task it was running is never
        # re-issued, so `map` blocks forever and the fit hangs — observed on
        # RAL 2026-08-29 (#1547). `(pool, None)` keeps likelihoods parallel
        # (`pool_l`) and makes bound training serial in the parent (`pool_s`),
        # which is negligible: 4 small MLPs fit on at most a few hundred
        # points.
        #
        # The pool is also built with nautilus's own `initialize_worker`, and is
        # handed over wrapped in `_LikelihoodWorkerPool`, so that the likelihood
        # is dispatched as `likelihood_worker`. Before a pool object was passed
        # in place of `pool=<int>` (e6279c53f, #1439), nautilus did this itself;
        # with a pool object it instead maps the bound `Fitness.call_wrap`, so
        # `multiprocessing` pickles the entire analysis (dataset, PSF convolver,
        # sparse operator, adapt images) into every task chunk and each worker
        # unpickles a fresh copy for every likelihood call. Worker memory then
        # grows by a few MB per call (8-core RAL runs reached the 96 GB cgroup
        # limit) while the parent starves the pool serialising it (#1547).
