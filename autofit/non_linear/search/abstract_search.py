                        used in your `log_likelihood_function` evaluation (e.g. NumPy, SciPy, scikit-learn) may attempt to
                        parallelize over all cores available.
    
                        This will lead to slow-down, due to overallocation of tasks over the CPUs.
    
                        To mitigate this, set the environment variables to 1 via the following command on your
                        bash terminal / command line:
    
                        export OPENBLAS_NUM_THREADS=1

                        export NUMEXPR_NUM_THREADS=1
    
                        This means only the non-linear search is parallelized over multiple cores.
    
                        If you "know what you are doing" and do not want these environment variables to be set to one, you 
                        can disable this warning by changing the following entry in the config files:

        resampling, and test mode must do the same rather than hard-fail on an
        artifact of its own choice of point.

        Try the prior medians first, then a deterministic sequence of prior
        draws, returning the first candidate ``validate`` accepts.  The fixed

        failure_prefix
            Opening of the :class:`FitException` message raised once the attempt
            budget is spent; the attempt count is appended to it.
        validate
            Called with each candidate vector.  Raising `FitException` rejects
            that candidate and moves on to the next draw; the return value is
            handed back alongside the accepted vector, so a caller that must
            build something in order to validate it does not build it twice.

        The result contains the non-linear search samples summary, which contains the maximum log likelihood instance
        that is used for visualization and prior passing via the search chaining API.

        This funciton may also load the full samples of the completed fit, for example if visualization of the
        seatch chains (e.g. a corner plot) is performed. This task is optional and be slow due to loading times.

        Optional tasks can be performed to update the results of the model-fit on hard-disk depending on the following
        entries of the `general.yaml` config file's `output` section:

        ` `force_visualize_overwrite=True`: the visualization of the model-fit is performed again (e.g. to
        add new visualizations or replot figures with a different source code).

        - `force_pickle_overwrite=True`: the output files of the model-fit are recreated (e.g. to add a new attribute
        that was previously not output).

        Parameters
        ----------
        analysis
            An object that encapsulates the data and a log likelihood function which fits the model to the data
            via the non-linear search.
        model
            The model that is fitted to the data, which is used by the non-linear search to create instances of
            the model that are fitted to the data via the log likelihood function.

        Returns
        -------
        The result of the non-linear search, which includes the best-fit model instance and best-fit log likelihood
        and errors on the model parameters.

        Sampler-specific keys to merge into ``samples_info`` when the

        **Opt-in, not a per-sampler obligation.** Most searches do not
        override this, and that is correct — no library code reads these
        diagnostic keys under bypass. The properties that read them
        (``SamplesMCMC.total_steps``, ``SamplesNest.total_samples``, …)
        live on ``Samples`` subclasses the bypass never constructs;
        ``_fit_bypass_test_mode`` always builds a ``SamplesPDF``. The only
        consumers are workspace scripts reading ``samples_info[...]``
        directly, so override this only when such a script exists.

        Which fix applies depends on what that script does with the keys:

        - It **prints** them (a tutorial, whose point is the prose, so it
          may legitimately run bypassed) → override here, returning NaN/0
          placeholders. The bypass did not sample; honest empties.
        - It **asserts** on them (a test) → the script must not run
          bypassed at all. Give it an ``ENV: real_search`` declaration
          instead. Do **not** add placeholders for an asserting reader:
          the assert then silently passes on a stub value, which is worse
          than the ``KeyError`` it replaced.

        Both live cases follow that split. ``BlackJAXNUTS`` overrides this
        because ``autofit_workspace/scripts/searches/mcmc.py`` prints
        ``ess_min`` / ``n_divergent``, carries no ``__Env__`` declaration
        and is in that workspace's ``smoke_tests.txt``, so it runs
        bypassed on every PR (PyAutoFit #1260).
        ``AbstractMultiStartGradient`` deliberately does not: its only
        reader asserts on ``total_steps``, so that script declares
        ``ENV: real_search jax`` instead (autofit_workspace_test #83).

        So the conversion lives here, once, instead of being re-derived (and

        it crashed the MultiStart gradient search for every user who set a real
