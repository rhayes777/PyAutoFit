                    The non-linear search is using multiprocessing (number_of_cores>1). 

                    However, the following environment variables have not been set to 1:

                    OPENBLAS_NUM_THREADS
                    MKL_NUM_THREADS
                    OMP_NUM_THREADS
                    VECLIB_MAXIMUM_THREADS
                    NUMEXPR_NUM_THREADS

                    This can lead to performance issues, because both the non-linear search and libraries that may be
                    used in your `log_likelihood_function` evaluation (e.g. NumPy, SciPy, scikit-learn) may attempt to
                    parallelize over all cores available.

                    This will lead to slow-down, due to overallocation of tasks over the CPUs.

                    To mitigate this, set the environment variables to 1 via the following command on your
                    bash terminal / command line:

                    export OPENBLAS_NUM_THREADS=1
                    export MKL_NUM_THREADS=1
                    export OMP_NUM_THREADS=1
                    export VECLIB_MAXIMUM_THREADS=1
                    export NUMEXPR_NUM_THREADS=1

                    This means only the non-linear search is parallelized over multiple cores.

                    If you "know what you are doing" and do not want these environment variables to be set to one, you 
                    can disable this warning by changing the following entry in the config files:

                    `config -> general.yaml -> parallel: -> warn_environment_variable=False`

        info
            Optional dictionary containing information about the fit that can be saved in the `files` folder

        """
        Start a non-linear search from scratch, or resumes one which was previously terminated mid-way through.

        If the search is resumed, the model-fit will begin by loading the samples from the previous search and
        from where it left off.

        After the search is completed, a `.completed` file is output so that if the search is resumed in the future
        it is not repeated and results are loaded via the `update_completed_fit` method.

        Results are also output to hard-disk in the `files` folder via the `save_results` method of the analysis class.
