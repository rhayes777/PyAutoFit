        """
        A BlackJAX adaptive tempered Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) non-linear search with a **gradient** inner
        kernel.

        SMC anneals a cloud of ``num_particles`` particles along a tempering path from a normalised starting
        distribution (``lambda = 0``) to the posterior (``lambda = 1``), moving the particles at each temperature
        with an inner MCMC kernel and reweighting/resampling between temperatures. Two properties make it the lead
        sampler of the JAX-native wave:

        1. It yields the **log evidence for free** -- the sum of every step's tempering
           ``log_likelihood_increment`` is ``log Z``, on the same scale a nested sampler reports.
        2. Its inner kernel is gradient-based (MALA by default, HMC optionally), so it exploits the JAX-native
           differentiable likelihood rather than random-walking.

        The autofit ``Analysis`` must therefore be constructed with ``use_jax=True`` (and JAX run in float64,
        ``JAX_ENABLE_X64=True``); a clear error is raised at fit time otherwise.

        For BlackJAX, see https://github.com/blackjax-devs/blackjax.

        **Whitening -- and why it is the whole game.** The inner kernel takes a single *scalar* step size, so the
        target must be close to isotropic and unit-scale for any step to work. The search therefore samples in a
        whitened space ``z``, related to the physical parameters by the affine map ``x = shift + L @ z``, and this
        is what ``inverse_mass_matrix`` sets:

        - **Prior-whitening does not whiten the posterior.** Measured on a 15-parameter lens model, the posterior
          is 269x anisotropic in prior-whitened coordinates (one parameter's prior scale is 8.0 against a
          posterior std of 2e-4). A scalar step tuned to the mean of that spread is ~88x too large for the
          tightest parameter and acceptance pins at exactly 0.000.
        - **Diagonal whitening is not enough.** The posterior is correlated (condition number 568, correlation
          coefficient 0.95 between two parameters); diagonal whitening leaves a thin *tilted* ridge a spherical
          proposal walks off.
          Whitening uses the **Cholesky factor of the full covariance**.
        - **Cold, there is nothing better than the prior scale**, which is what ``inverse_mass_matrix=None``
          falls back to.

        **Warm starting -- and how the evidence survives it.** These samplers are meant to be handed a starting
        point near the maximum-likelihood solution by a JAX optimizer; cold-benchmarking them is not a fair test
        (on the lens model above, every cold arm sat ~190,000 log-units below the optimizer's solution). To warm
        start::

            search = af.SMC(
                initializer=result.start_point_from(),
                inverse_mass_matrix=result,
            )

        Simply dropping the particles at the previous best fit would **destroy the log evidence**, which is only
        valid when tempering starts from a *normalised* distribution. So the warm path does not shortcut
        ``lambda``: it still starts the tempering at ``lambda = 0``, but from a normalised Gaussian reference
        ``g = N(shift, L L^T)`` centred on the warm-start point rather than from the prior, bridging

        .. code::

            log target_lambda = log g + lambda * (log prior + log L - log g)

        onto BlackJAX's ``logprior_fn + lambda * loglikelihood_fn``. Because ``g`` integrates to 1, the
        accumulated increments still estimate ``log Z = log integral(prior * L)`` -- the true evidence, directly
        comparable to Nautilus. The prior must carry its normalisation here (it cancels in a Metropolis ratio but
        **not** in the evidence), and the whitening Jacobian ``log|det L|`` is added back.

        **Judging a run.** Never judge an SMC fit by "it reached ``lambda = 1``". When acceptance collapses to ~0,
        adaptive tempering can force a single huge increment straight to ``lambda = 1`` and report a meaningless
        ``log_evidence`` while still looking converged. Judge it by the per-step acceptance trace and the
        max-log-likelihood progression, both recorded in ``search_internal`` and surfaced on `SamplesSMC` as
        ``acceptance_rate_list`` / ``lambda_list`` / ``ess_list``.

        Parameters
        ----------
        name
            The name of the search, controlling the last folder results are output to.
        path_prefix
            The path of folders prefixing the name folder where results are output.
        unique_tag
            A unique tag for this model-fit, used as a folder between the path prefix and the search name and as
            the SQLite identifier.
        num_particles
            The number of SMC particles carried along the tempering path. This is also the number of posterior
            samples the fit returns.
        kernel
            The gradient inner kernel used to move the particles at each temperature: ``"mala"`` (default) or
            ``"hmc"``. HMC holds acceptance far higher as ``lambda -> 1`` but costs ~4x the likelihood/gradient
            evaluations; measured on the lens model, plain MALA matched its max log likelihood and log evidence at
            a quarter of the evaluations.
        num_mcmc_steps
            The number of inner-kernel updates applied to every particle at each temperature.
        num_integration_steps
            Leapfrog steps per HMC trajectory. Ignored when ``kernel="mala"``.
        target_ess
            The effective sample size, as a fraction of ``num_particles``, that adaptive tempering targets when
            choosing each ``lambda`` increment. Higher means a finer schedule (more, smaller steps).
        step_size
            The inner kernel's step size, in whitened units. ``None`` (default) auto-scales it from the target
            width (see below). **Units trap:** MALA proposes ``x + eps*grad + sqrt(2*eps)*xi``, so its
            ``step_size`` is a *squared* length and the proposal length is ``sqrt(2*eps)``; HMC's step size is a
            length. The auto-scaling applies the optimal MALA rule ``ell = 2.38 * d^(-1/6) * sigma``,
            ``eps = ell^2 / 2``, and ``sigma * d^(-1/4)`` for HMC, so a hand-set ``step_size`` must respect the
            same convention. There is deliberately **no per-temperature step adaptation**: BlackJAX's
            ``inner_kernel_tuning`` was measured to *collapse* acceptance (0.04-0.12, worse than a fixed step's
            0.84 -> 0.15 decay) on this problem.
        whiten_inflate
            The warm-start Gaussian reference is deliberately widened by this factor so it *covers* the posterior
            (the tempering path misses mass if the reference is narrower than the target). It also sets the auto
            step size: in whitened units the reference has width 1 but the posterior has width ``1 /
            whiten_inflate``, so the step targets the **posterior** width. Targeting the reference width instead
            overshoots by ``whiten_inflate^2`` and pins acceptance at zero (measured: ``eps=1.148 -> acc 0.00``,
            ``eps=0.1 -> acc 0.94``).
        max_smc_steps
            A hard cap on the number of SMC temperatures, so a pathological run terminates instead of annealing
            forever. A run that hits it is reported as not converged.
        batch_size
            Forwarded to BlackJAX: when ``> 0``, particles are processed in sequential batches of this size via
            ``jax.lax.map`` instead of one full ``jax.vmap``, trading speed for peak GPU memory. ``0`` (default)
            keeps the full ``vmap``.
        seed
            Integer seed passed to ``jax.random.PRNGKey``.
        initializer
            Generates the initial particles. Defaults to `InitializerPrior` -- **cold SMC's evidence requires the
            particles to be drawn from the prior**, so the `InitializerBall` default the other MCMC searches use
            would silently invalidate ``log_evidence``. When warm-started (``inverse_mass_matrix`` given), the
            initializer supplies only the *centre* of the Gaussian reference and the particles are drawn from that
            reference instead -- pass ``result.start_point_from()`` (equivalently
            ``InitializerParamStartPoints.from_result(result)``).
        inverse_mass_matrix
            The covariance the sampling space is whitened by (named for API parity with `BlackJAXNUTS`, where the
            same specification seeds window adaptation's metric):

            - ``None`` (default): cold. Whiten by the per-parameter prior width.
            - a 1-D ``numpy`` array of shape ``(n_dim,)``: a diagonal covariance.
            - a 2-D ``numpy`` array of shape ``(n_dim, n_dim)``: a full covariance, Cholesky-factorised.
            - a `Result` or `Samples` object: its ``samples.covariance_matrix``. Raises ``ValueError`` if that
              covariance looks MLE-only (too few samples, or non-finite / identity) -- pass an explicit array in
              that case, e.g. from a Laplace approximation.

            The ``"diagonal"`` / ``"dense"`` strings `BlackJAXNUTS` accepts are **rejected** here: they name an
            adaptation strategy, and SMC does not adapt its metric, so they would silently give a cold run.
        auto_correlation_settings
            Kept for API parity with the other MCMC searches. SMC particles are not a chain, so no
            auto-correlation diagnostics are computed and ``check_for_convergence`` defaults to ``False``.
        iterations_per_full_update
            Inherited from the autonerves config when ``None``. SMC calls ``perform_update`` once per
            temperature (SMC steps are coarse and few), so this does not chunk the run.
        number_of_cores
            Used only when generating the initial particles. The tempering loop itself runs vmapped on a single
            device.
        silence
            If True, the default print output of the non-linear search is silenced.
        session
            An SQLalchemy session instance.
