        aggregator tools.

        For this analysis the following are output:

        - The dataset's data.
        - The dataset's noise-map.

        It is common for these attributes to be loaded by many of the template aggregator functions given in the
        `aggregator` modules. For example, when using the database tools to reperform a fit, this will by default
        load the dataset, settings and other attributes necessary to perform a fit using the attributes output by
        this function.

        Parameters
        ----------
        paths
            The paths object which manages all paths, e.g. where the non-linear search outputs are stored,
            visualization, and the pickled objects used by the aggregator output by this function.

        Returns the `Result` of the non-linear search after it is completed.

        The result type is defined as a class variable in the `Analysis` class (see top of code under the python code
        `class Analysis(af.Analysis)`.

        The result can be manually overwritten by a user to return a user-defined result object, which can be extended
        with additional methods and attribute specific to the model-fit.

        This example class does example this, whereby the analysis result has been over written with the `ResultExample`
        class, which contains a property `max_log_likelihood_model_data_1d` that returns the model data of the
        best-fit model. This API means you can customize your result object to include whatever attributes you want
        and therefore make a result object specific to your model-fit and model-fitting problem.

        The `Result` object you return can be customized to include:

        - The samples summary, which contains the maximum log likelihood instance and median PDF model.

        - The paths of the search, which are used for loading the samples and search internal below when a search
        is resumed.

        - The samples of the non-linear search (e.g. MCMC chains) also stored in `samples.csv`.

        - The non-linear search used for the fit in its internal representation, which is used for resuming a search
        and making bespoke visualization using the search's internal results.

        - The analysis used to fit the model (default disabled to save memory, but option may be useful for certain
        projects).

        Parameters
        ----------
        samples_summary
            The summary of the samples of the non-linear search, which include the maximum log likelihood instance and
            median PDF model.
        paths
            An object describing the paths for saving data (e.g. hard-disk directories or entries in sqlite database).
        samples
            The samples of the non-linear search, for example the chains of an MCMC run.
        search_internal
            The internal representation of the non-linear search used to perform the model-fit.
        analysis
            The analysis used to fit the model.

        Returns
        -------
        Result
            The result of the non-linear search, which is defined as a class variable in the `Analysis` class.

    def compute_latent_variables(self, parameters, model) -> Dict[str, float]:
        """
        A latent variable is not a model parameter but can be derived from the model. Its value and errors may be
        of interest and aid in the interpretation of a model-fit.

        For example, for the simple 1D Gaussian example, it could be the full-width half maximum (FWHM) of the
        Gaussian. This is not included in the model but can be easily derived from the Gaussian's sigma value.

        By overwriting this method we can manually specify latent variables that are calculated and output to
        a `latent.csv` file, which mirrors the `samples.csv` file.

        In the example below, the `latent.csv` file will contain one column with the FWHM of every Gausian model
        sampled by the non-linear search.

        This function is called at the end of search, following one of two schemes depending on the settings in
        `output.yaml`:

        1) Call for every search sample, which produces a complete `latent/samples.csv` which mirrors the normal
        `samples.csv` file but takes a long time to compute.

        2) Call only for N random draws from the posterior inferred at the end of the search, which only produces a
        `latent/latent_summary.json` file with the median and 1 and 3 sigma errors of the latent variables but is
        fast to compute.

        Parameters
        ----------
        instance
            The instances of the model which the latent variable is derived from.
