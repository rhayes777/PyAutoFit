        During a model-fit, the `visualize` method is called throughout the non-linear search and is used to output
        images indicating the quality of the fit so far.

        which is used to perform the visualization (e.g. it generates the model data which is plotted).

        The `instance` passed into the visualize method is maximum log likelihood solution obtained by the model-fit

        instance
            An instance of the model that is being fitted to the data by this analysis (whose parameters have been set

        during_analysis
