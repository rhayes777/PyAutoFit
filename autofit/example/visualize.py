        During a model-fit, the `visualize` method is called throughout the non-linear search and is used to output
        images indicating the quality of the fit so far.

        The function receives as input an instance of the `Analysis` class which is being used to perform the fit,
        which is used to perform the visualization (e.g. it generates the model data which is plotted).

        The `instance` passed into the visualize method is maximum log likelihood solution obtained by the model-fit

        instance
