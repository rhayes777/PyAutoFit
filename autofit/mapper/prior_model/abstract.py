        Assert that some relationship holds between physical values associated with

        The assertion is enforced differently on the two array backends, but with the same
        outcome -- the non-linear search never selects a violating model:

        - **numpy**: `check_assertions` raises a ``FitException`` when the assertion fails, which
          :class:`~autofit.non_linear.fitness.Fitness` catches and turns into the resample figure
          of merit.
        - **JAX**: raising is impossible inside a trace, so the assertion is instead evaluated as
          a traced boolean by `assertions_satisfied_from_vector` and applied by
          :class:`~autofit.non_linear.fitness.Fitness` with ``xp.where``, mapping a violating
          model to the resample figure of merit. This is a **value-only** penalty, carrying the
          same gradient caveat as the NaN guards documented on `Fitness.call`.

        Both paths enforce assertions attached anywhere in the model tree: numpy because each
        model checks its own as its instance is built, JAX because `gathered_assertions` collects
        them from the whole tree.

        declaration is structural rather than a second violation measure.

        This is **static geometry**: it depends only on how the model is
        composed, never on the parameter values, so it is resolved once and
        cached (following :attr:`parameterization`'s convention of an
        underscore-prefixed ``__dict__`` key, which the pytree-flattening and
        ``ModelInstance`` construction paths both skip). A search resolves it
        outside its step loop and traces only the arithmetic.

        A declared ball is **skipped**, rather than raising, in two cases, both
        of which are ordinary model composition rather than a mistake:

        - the declaring component has no such attribute at all, because every
          coordinate was fixed to an instance (a spherical profile pins
          ``ell_comps`` to ``(0.0, 0.0)``, so there is nothing to project);
        - fewer than two of the coordinates are free priors, because the user
          fixed one of them. A ball with a coordinate held constant is an
          interval on the remainder, which is a different projection and not one
          this pair-shaped list can express.

        The largest constraint violation any component reports for this vector.

        Zero means every declared constraint is satisfied. The value is traced,

        point, since the exception-based path (:meth:`add_assertion`,
        ``validate_ell_comps``) cannot run inside a trace at all. See
        :mod:`autofit.mapper.prior_model.constraint`.

        Components are instantiated individually rather than by building the
        whole model, so a model declaring no constraints costs nothing.

        Note that on the NumPy path a component's own ``__init__`` validation may
        raise before its constraint is ever evaluated — that is the existing
        concrete-scalar guard behaviour and is deliberately not suppressed here.
