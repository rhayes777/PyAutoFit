"""
Class-declared model constraints, evaluated as traced values.

This is the differentiable sibling of :meth:`AbstractPriorModel.add_assertion`.
Assertions are attached to a *model instance* by the user. On the NumPy path they
signal failure by raising :class:`FitException`, which :class:`Fitness` catches,
returning the resample sentinel. A ``raise`` cannot happen inside a JAX trace — it
needs a concrete boolean, and the condition there is a tracer, which gives
``TracerBoolConversionError`` — so under JAX the assertion is instead evaluated as
a **traced boolean** and applied by :class:`Fitness` as an ``xp.where`` penalty
that maps a violating model to the resample sentinel. Assertions therefore survive
``jit`` and ``vmap``, but as a *value-only* rejection: reverse-mode
differentiates both branches of that ``where``, so the penalty carries no usable
gradient back into the valid region. This is also why guards such as
``autogalaxy.profiles.validate.validate_ell_comps`` return early for non-concrete
scalars rather than raising: the escape hatch is load-bearing, or every jitted
likelihood would crash instead of sampling.

A model constraint differs in exactly two ways:

- it is declared **on the class**, so every model built from that class carries
  it without the user remembering to attach anything;
- it is evaluated as a **traced non-negative violation measure** rather than a
  boolean, so it survives ``jit``, ``vmap`` and ``grad`` — a magnitude carries a
  gradient back into the valid region where the assertion ``where`` cannot.

Declaring one
-------------

A class declares a constraint by defining ``__model_constraint__``, which takes
the array module and returns a non-negative violation measure — ``0`` when the
constraint is satisfied, growing with the severity of the violation:

.. code-block:: python

    class EllProfile:
        def __model_constraint__(self, xp=np):
            magnitude = xp.sqrt(
                self.ell_comps[0] ** 2 + self.ell_comps[1] ** 2
            )
            return xp.maximum(magnitude - 0.999, 0.0)

A *measure* rather than a boolean deliberately: a bool is enough for the
diagnostic counters that consume this today, but a magnitude is what a penalty
term would need later, and it carries a usable gradient back into the valid
region. Returning a bool would work for counting and then have to be redesigned.

Declaring a ball
----------------

``__model_constraint__`` *measures* a violation; it cannot say how to fix one.
A search that wants to keep its parameters inside the valid region needs the
constraint's **structure**, not just its magnitude, and for the commonest case —
a pair of parameters confined to a disk, ``e0**2 + e1**2 < r**2`` — the structure
is fully described by the coordinates involved and the radius.

``__model_ball_constraints__`` declares exactly that, as a class attribute (not a
method: it is static geometry, resolved once from the model rather than evaluated
per step):

.. code-block:: python

    class EllProfile:
        __model_ball_constraints__ = ((("ell_comps",), 0.999),)

Each entry is a ``(path, radius)`` pair. ``path`` is a tuple of attribute names
navigating from the declaring component to the
:class:`~autofit.mapper.prior.tuple_prior.TuplePrior` whose components are the
ball's coordinates; ``radius`` is the radius the coordinates are confined within.

This is deliberately **not** a second statement of the same fact as
``__model_constraint__``, but the projectable form of it. The measure is what a
counter or a penalty term reads; the ball is what
:class:`~autofit.non_linear.clipper.ClipperPriorBoxJoint` projects onto. A class
may declare either, or both, independently.

The radius a class declares should be the threshold **its own maths** needs, not
the boundary of formal validity. For ``ell_comps`` those differ: the geometry is
undefined at magnitude ``1``, but the conversion to an axis ratio saturates at
``0.999``, and the annulus between them is a dead-gradient region a search can
sit in while still passing every validity check. Projecting onto the clamp keeps
lanes out of it; projecting onto ``1 - epsilon`` would park them in it.
