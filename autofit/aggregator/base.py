        """
        Base aggregator wrapper, which makes it straight forward to compute generators of instances of objects from
        specific samples of a non-linear search.

        The stadard aggregator makes it straight forward to create instances from the model. However, if there
        are other classes which are generated from the model. but not part of the model itself, creating
        instances of them with samples from the non-linear, via a generator, requires manual code to be written.

        The base aggregator can be used to streamline this process and create a concise API for generating these
        instances.

        This is achieved by overwriting the `object_via_gen_from` method, which is used to create the object from
        the non-linear search samples. This method is then used to create generators of the object from the
        non-linear search samples.

        Parameters
        ----------
        aggregator
            An PyAutoFit aggregator containing the results of non-linear searches performed by PyAutoFit.

        For example, in the `GalaxiesAgg` object, this function is overwritten such that it creates a `Plane` from a
        `ModelInstance` that contains the galaxies of a sample from a non-linear search.

        Parameters
        ----------
        fit
            A PyAutoFit database Fit object containing the generators of the results of PyAutoGalaxy model-fits.
        instance
            A manual instance that overwrites the max log likelihood instance in fit (e.g. for drawing the instance

        Returns a generator which for every result generates a list of objects whose parameter values are all those
        in the non-linear search with a weight about an input `minimum_weight` value. This enables straight forward
        error estimation.

        This generator creates lists containing instances whose non-linear sample weight are above the value of
        `minimum_weight`. For example, if the aggregator contains 10 results and each result has 100 samples above the
        `minimum_weight`, a list of 10 entries will be returned, where each entry in this list contains 100 object's
